+Added files for ATL demo
    
+New Hanako sundress sprites

+Teaset

+Revised Act 4 Hanako True title card

+Added shizu_adjust_angryblush.png

***ui_settings.rpy***
+Added "ks_bg("city_funeral")" at line 117 under the background declaration section

+Added 'adjust_noglasses', at line 513, under Shizune's sprite declaration list

+Added sfx_camera = "sfx/shutterfilm.ogg" at line 1547, under the sound effects mapping

+Ported the flashback filter from the final game to the alpha

+In Shizune's sprite declarations list, added the labels 'nak', 'gown', and 'bra' to the list builder

+Added ks_bg("hosp_room3") to the background declaration list

+Changed menueffect = dissolve to menueffect = None, so it looks and feels like the final menus

+Commented out the alpha's version of the music list

+Imported the ks_music() function from the final, and alphabetized all the tracks

+Added line ex_m_tracks = [] above ks_music()

+Added the static effect used in flashbacks from the final, consists of a python function called noisetile() and an image declaration called staticoverlay

+Added line "Position = Transform" near the top of the file. We believe that this turns all mentions of Position() into aliases of Transform()

+Added code for all of Twoface's art

+Added all of Twoface's art to the gallery

+Changed the name for the track Aria to the correct one.

+Added adjustblush to Shizune's sprite definitions

+Added functions generalbounce(), tf_fourbounce60, emiannoyedbouncecomp, and image emi annoyedbounce to fix a broken animation in Act 1

+Replaced the Slide() function with the Slide transform from the final

***imachine.rpy***
+Added the two lines of code below to the beginning of scenes S32, S33, S34, S36, S37, and S38

    call rinscene ("rintimeskip")
    pass
    
+Changed all existing iscene calls to rinscene calls for scenes S32, S33, S34, S36, S37, and S38.
    __IMPORTANT__ Do not change the iscene call in S31. There will be a glitch if that happens.
    
+Brought scene S37 back from the dead

+Changed the code for S33 to this
label S33:
    call rinscene ("rintimeskip")
    pass
    call rinscene ("S33")
    call imenu ("choiceS33")
    if _return == m1:
        jump_out S34
    elif _return == m2:
        jump_out S36
It was causing a problem the way it was previously where the title for S33 (Watershed) would show up in for S36's title (On the Flipside) in the pause menu.

+Changed the code for S33 again:
label S33:
    call rinscene ("rintimeskip")
    pass
    call rinscene ("S33")
    call imenu ("choiceS33a")
    if _return == m1:
        call rinscene ("S33a")
    elif _return == m2:
        call rinscene ("S33b")
    call rinscene ("S33c")
    call imenu ("choiceS33b")
    if _return == m1:
        jump_out S34
    elif _return == m2:
        jump_out S36
        
This brings back the choice on whether to tell Yuuko about Shizune's lip reading ability

+Changed the code for S36 to this:
label S36:
    #S35 does not exist because of lolA22
    call rinscene ("rintimeskip")
    pass
    call rinscene ("S36")
    if seen_scene ("S25h") or seen_scene ("S15b"):
        call rinscene ("S36a")
    else:
        call rinscene ("S36b")
    call rinscene ("S36c")
    jump_out S37
    
This adds a deleted scene split back to the game.

+Added timeskip to S10

***ui-strings.rpy***
+Added scene S37 back into the library

+Added line displayDict['en'].game_menu_current_music = u"Current music track"

***ui_code.rpy***
+Commented out the menu() function

+Added function get_music_name()

***ui_ingamemenu.rpy***
+Commented out the presistant.breadcrumbs for loop in custom_menu()

+Commented out persistent.breadcrumbs.append((location, val)) in clicked() which is in show_menu()

***ui_labels.rpy***
+Commented out original label gm_bare

+Added label gm_bare from the final

+Commented out the python block in the splashscreen_4ls() function and replaced it with the splashscreen() function from the original Act 1 demo
    This fixes a bug that ocasionally caused the screen to stay black after the intro cutscene and splashscreen

***ui_i18n.rpy***
+Commented out ex_m_tracks and all its related lines

Bugs:
