***NOTE TO ANY FUTURE ALPHA DEVS***
The below code references are in absolutely no way exhaustive. There is very likely stuff that I have missed, and some of the stuff that is here is incomplete, and some of it may even be totally incorrect (Protip: Anything marked with "Needs more testing" is probably wrong). This was mainly intended to be a quick reference guide for myself. Feel free to use it and update it though. Other future devs may find it useful.

--

Scene--
scene <type> <picture name> at <position> with <modifier>
Also can be used for solid colors
EX: scene black

type
    bg = static background
    ev = preedrawn CG scene

at - for use with backgrounds that can pan
    bgleft    
    bgright
    center

**Zoom**
Used for evs that, well..... zoom
EX: scene ev rin_eating at Zoom((800,600), (159,0,640,480), (0,0,800,600), 10, time_warp=acdc_warp)
From script-a1-wednesday.rpy, during scene "A Private Lunch" 
Needs to be experimented with

**RotoZoom**
I assume this is used for twisting and zooming simultaneously. Probably needs lots of experimentation
scene bg school_track_on at RotoZoom(0,-6,0.1,1.0,1.2,0.1, xalign=0.5, yalign=0.52)

modifiers
    charachange - Used for CGs with changing character expressions
    clockwipe
    dissolve(<variable>) - Variable is (probably) the number of seconds
    fade
    handsin - Used with Misha's guess who scenes
    handsout
    locationchange - Fades from one scene to another
    locationskip - Fade out from one scene than fade to another
    openeye - Used for waking scenes
    shorttimeskip - Rotating columns transition
    shuteye
    slowfade
    whiteout
    
For panning scenes, "_start" appended to the scene name is the initial part. 
Appending "_move" later starts panning. 
"_end" skips to the last part of the scene
    Unconfirmed as of now. Needs to be tested. Naturally, should only work with scenes bigger than 800x600

--Show--
show <character name> <pose> at <position> with <modifier>
hide <character name>
	
position
	left - to the left of default position, useful for three sprites on screen
	right - same as left, but on the right (duh)
	twoleft - useful for 2 sprites on screen
	tworight - as is this
    offscreenright - sprite is off screen to right, useful for exiting sprites
    offscreenleft

    behind - Forces one sprite to be overlapped by another
    
    Fullpan(<Variable>) - I assume this pans all the way across a large cg in X amount of time
        Needs some testing before use
    
    Slide<multiple variables separated by comma> - seems to cause a sprite to move, need to test it out first
        ----Possible explanation on the variables
        There are 5 variables in the Slide() parameter.
        The first 2 might be the start position on an X/Y plane
        The second pair may be the end position
        The final number may be the rate at which they slide
        Still Needs testing
        ----Slide modifiers
        time_warp=_ease_out_time_warp

**Custom Positions**
After "at" use "Position(<variables>)"
EXAMPLE:
    show hanako emb_downtimid at Position(xanchor=0.8, xpos=1.0) - Hanako's first appearance in Act 1

variables - Used to set the custom positions
    All of the following appear to do different things, although what is a mystery for now
    xanchor and xpos have been seen working together

xanchor=<variable>
xpos=<variable>
xalign=<variable> - seems to be the most basic, and perhaps the most useful
yalign=<variable>

modifiers - only need to use once when multiple sprites are changing poses
    charachange - Transition from one sprite pose to another
    characlose - Transition from normal sprite to close sprite
    charadistant - Transition from close sprite to normal sprite
    charaenter - Sprite fadein
    charaexit - Sprite fadeout
    charamove - Causes a sprite to move on screen when its location is changed
    charamove_deccel - Causes a sprite to move with deceleration
    **MIGHT BE A charamove_accel**
    charamoveinleft - Causes a sprite to appear from offscreen left
    charamoveinright - Causes a sprite to appear from offscreen right
    charamoveoutleft - Causes a sprite to exit stage left
    charamoveoutright - Causes a sprite to exit stage right
    **MIGHT BE VERSIONS OF charamoveout/in FOR TOP AND BOTTOM**
    ease - Faster version of charamove
    ease_accel - Causes a sprite to accelerate as it moves
    ease_decel - Causes a sprite to decelerate as it moves
    easeinbottom - Causes a sprite to enter frame from bottom
    easeinleft
    **MIGHT BE VERSIONS OF easein FOR TOP, LEFT, RIGHT**
    easeoutleft - Faster version of charamoveoutleft
    easeoutright - Faster version of charamoveoutright
    fade - Causes a sprite to fade into the background, **NEEDS TESTING**
    flash - White out with fade in
    hpunch - Causes the screen to shake left and right
    shuteyefast - Causes a quick eye effect
    **MIGHT HAVE A NORMAL VERSION WITH VARIOUS SPEEDS**
    slice_in - Only seen during Lilly's and Shizune's showdown in Act 1 as far as i'm aware. Ignore for now.
    vpunch - Causes screen to shake up and down
    zoomin - Does just that. **NEEDS TESTING**
    
Also for animation FX
    crowd - Typical crowd movement, seen during Yamaku festival
    fireworks - As seen at the end of Act 1
    heartattack alpha - Used for heart attacks, only quick flashes
    heartattack residual - Used when you need the heart attack graphic on screen for a while
    hospitalmask - Used during Hisao's inital hospital stay in act 1. Probably safe to ignore. Was used with sakura
    passoutOP1 - Spiral Death swirls
    sakura - Used during Hisao's inital hospital stay in act 1. Probably safe to ignore. Was used with sakura
    snow - FUCKING SNOW!
    steam - Like the water vapor
    steam2 - More water vapor
    newsteam - Transitional water vapor
    newsteam2 - More transitional water vapor

--Filters--
Use these to show the passage of time on the backgrounds and sprites
Some backgrounds have their own hard versions already, and will be invoked in place of using the filters
Append these to either the background file or sprite file name to use

_ss = sunset
_ni = night
_tremble - This might be another filter, used to make Hanako shake in the library in Act 1, needs testing.
_facepullout - Seems to cause the camera to zoom out, used during act 1 when Emi knocks into Hisao
_largepullout - another animation used, shows all of a CG scene with a bit of panning out, also used when Emi knocks into Hisao in Act 1
silhouette_ - Appending this to the front of a character's pose will cause a silhouette

--Music/Sound--
play <type> <name> fadein <fade delay> with <modifier>
stop <type> fadeout <fade delay>

Modifiers from the visual scenes above can be used here as well

When using ambient sound, the following may be set after the ambient is initiated
$ renpy.music.set_volume(<variable1>, <variable2>, channel="ambient")
    need to find out what those variables do, can also be used to adjust volume on the fly
$ renpy.music.set_volume(0.4,1.0)

type
    music
    sound
    ambient

--Text Modifiers--
**NVL Mode**
nv1 show Dissolve<variable> = full screen textbox
    use this with `n "<Text Goes Here>"`
nv1 hide Dissolve<variable>
nv1 clear
centered "<Text Goes Here>" = Text in the Middle of the screen without a text box

**Notes**
$ written_note("<Text Goes Here>")
    uses escape character \n to force a new line, will word wrap with longer sentences

These go in the middle of normal text and cause the following actions
    {w} - needs an extra click to display the rest of the line
    {w=<variable>} - this causes a delay in the display of text
    {fast} - causes text to appear instantly
    {nw} - causes the next line to appear without needing a click
    {b}<text goes here>{/b} - Bolds the text inside

--Misc--
window hide
window show
wallodrugs - as seen in the prologue, probably wont need this, but for completions sake
    $ renpy.show("wallodrugsbg", what=drugsDisp(1600,800), at_list=[Pan((0.0,0.0),(1.0,0.0),25.0, time_warp=_ease_in_time_warp)])
show emi gymbounce = Emi Jumps up and down, as seen in Act 1 "The Running Girl"
Pause(<variable>) - variable is seconds

--Predefined characters--
hi = hisao
mi = misha
nk = nurse (normal)
nk_ = nurse (initial)
hh = hideakibg
mu_ = mutou initial (tall man)
mu = mutou (normal)
mi_shi = When Hisao originally thinks Misha is Shizune in Act 1
mi_not_shi = Same as above, but with Shizune crossed out with appended Misha name
shi = Shizune (Not Signing)
ke_ = Kenji (before introduction)
ke = kenji
li_ = Lilly (Before Introduction)
li = Lilly
mystery = ??? as character name
yu_ = Yuuko (Before Introduction)
ha_ = Hanako (Before Introduction)
emi_ = Emi (Before introduction)
emi = Emi
rim_ = Rin )Before Introduction)

--imachine.rpy--
Main flow control of KS. Used for overall scene direction and loading

To invoke the KS logo clockwipe thing, use "call iscene ("timeskip")" where needed

--Choices--
Probably wont need this unless modding or filling in a completely missing scene.
This ties into some stuff with imachine, but I'm not concerned with that now.
Will fill this in later. Theoretically expandable to n number of choices. Syntax goes like

label <choice name>:
menu:
    with menueffect
    <Text for the text box goes here>

    <Choice 1 Text>:
        return m1

    <Choice 2 Text>:
        return m2
