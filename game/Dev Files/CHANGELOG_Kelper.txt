REMINDER, BEFORE FINAL RELEASE:



REMINDER TO GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER (this will for next release, after aki completes her stuff)

 




Done Stuff from the reminders: 


REMINDER TO REPLACE THE LOW KNOCKS WITH "HAMMER" (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK THE H-SCENE FILTER (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK THE VOLUME OF SFX "IMPACT" IN THE OLD FILES (done!) 

REMINDER TO CHECK ALL WINDOW SHOW/HIDEs FOR TRANSITIONS (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK ALL NVLs FOR TRANSITIONS (DONT FORGET RINBABBLE!) (done!)

REMINDER TO TRY TO FIX EMI IN THE SKY OF DIAMONDS TRANSITION IN THE BEGINNING OF ACT 2 (done!)
Added layer kelpersux, (l. 23 on ui.settings)

REMINDER TO CHECK FULLPAN INSTANCES (they are fixed now, except for the Shanghai scene, but you have to skip through the scene to find the bug, and people shouldn't do that anyway, so seeing it would be their damn fault... done, I guess)

REMINDER TO CHECK EVERY SHORTTIMESKIP TRANSITION AND REPLACE IT FOR THE SILENT VERSION, IF NEEDED (done!)

REMINDER TO SEARCH FOR A TRAY CLATTER SOUND EFFECT (?) NEEDED FOR YUUKO IN ACT 2 LINE 4513 (done!)

REMINDER TO ADD THAT EMI SPRITE AT THE START OF THE ROUTE YOUKNOWHERE (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK IF THERES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CROWD LOOKING WEIRD DURING EMIS TRACK MEET (done!)

REMINDER TO UNIFY TRANSITIONS TO BACKGROUNDS AT THE START OF EVERY ACT (done!)

REMINDER TO ASK AKI ABOUT COSINE BASED TRANSITIONS AND LINE 2385 OF FINAL ACT 4 SCRIPT (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE FOR THE LIGHT RAIN STUFF (maybe using Alpha() function?) (done!)

UPDATE (18/11): Could find someone to fix CGs and Sprites: REMINDER TO ADD Gift of Gab TO THE CREDITS. rin_painting_whatever (except for foot) was changed to .png in ui_settings definition.

REMINDER TO TAKE THE RAIN FILTER OUT IN THE ARTSHOP SCENE (done!)

REMINDER TO ADD BWildness TO THE CREDITS UNDER "Also Helped" (done!, also changed @__akiaki to Aki<3 at her request, added Parity as a helper, and took out s37 from the extras, since it doesnt exist and made the game have some.. selfesteem issues. Everything new on ui-strings. Oh and I deleted "B" and Anonymous temporarily from the creds, who the hell are they?)

REMINDER TO CHECK SCENES NOT SEPARATED BY TIMESKIP (done!)

Oh god, Ive found a game destroying bug doing the above.---> REMINDER TO ASK AKI TO FIX IT. 
Wtf, found another. If you save the game with the imenu on the screen and pick a choice, everything explodes.---> Found cause of this bug: Akis modding of scene_register, line 106 in _ui_early.rpy. Don't know exactly what inside the definition fucks stuff. If you change it back to the original leaks code, it doesnt crash.
Update 2/12/13: Aki <3 fixed both bugs, the first one was a problem in ui_early (game crashed every time you tried to load a scene on an option menu and then picked an option), second was on z_jumper. Idk if being grateful, since aki caused both bugs but then fixed them. Let's say I am. 
Back to work. 	

REMINDER TO COMMENT EDITIONS I DID ON THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT (done!, although I could go back to this on an update)

REMINDER TO FIX CREDITS (sort of done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK EVERY FADE TO BLACK AT THE END OF THE SCENES (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK RAIN SOUND WHEN IT HAPPENS ON INTERIORS (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK VOLUMES OF AMBIENT SOUND FOR ALL THE ACTS (done!)

REMINDER TO CHECK VOLUME OF "HAMMER" (done!, but could check harder)

FOR THE LOVE OF RIN, DELETE PERSISTENT AND RPYC FILES BEFORE RELEASE (done!)
