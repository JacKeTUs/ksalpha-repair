    "He draws closer, squinting through his impossibly thick glasses."

    ke "Lilly? Lilly Satou, the blind girl from our year?"

    hi "Yeah, we've been hanging out a bit recently…"

    "Kenji sours."

    ke "Well, how nice for you. I suppose you'll want her information then…"

    hi "Information?"

    ke "I've gathered data on practically every girl in the school."

    ke "It's a good tactic. Sun Tsu even. Know your enemy."

    "Something tells me that Kenji's view on women may not mirror reality."

    hi "Um, great. I'll keep that in mind…"

    "Kenji pats me on the shoulder."

    ke "Any time, partner."

    "And with a parting wink, he heads back down the corridor to his room."
    
    "I wonder, just what is going through his mind at times like these."
    
    "Does he hate women, or is he just so obsessed with them that he can't stop thinking about them?"
    
    "Or maybe both?"

    "Anyway, my distraction has now left me, so I pull my door closed and head for Lilly's room."

    ha "Coming…"

    "The door swings inwards, and once again I am treated to the sight of the two girls in their bedclothes."

    ha "You came…"

    li "Hello again, Hisao."
    
    hi "Hi. Sorry about the delay, I got held up a little in the dorm."
    
    li "That's fine, the water has only just finished boiling."

    "Hanako gently raises herself from the table, and gets a small tin down from the bookcase."
    
    "She busies herself with the small teapot, placing the steaming china on the table."
    
    hi "Thanks, Hanako."

    "As if on cue, Hanako looks back towards the ground and smiles a little."

    ha "T…that's okay."

    "She takes a shaky step backwards, and trips on the corner of the table."

    hi "Look out!"

    "I jump up and catch Hanako before she falls onto Lilly."

    "For a brief second, we are in each other's embrace, our faces nearly touching."

    "The room is still."

    "…"
    
    li "Are you alright, Hanako?"

    "I gently release Hanako, who simply stands there in a state of embarrassed shock."

    "Hanako seems to snap out of her reverie."

    ha "Oh… Y… ye… fine."

    "Slowly, she sits back down at the table, shaking like a leaf."

    "I brew the tea in Lilly's small teapot, and pour out the three cups."

    "Lilly is the first to try the tea, as Hanako still seems to be in some kind of shock."

    li "Hmmm. That's pretty good, Hanako."

    "I take a sip myself."

    "I can't find anything particularly special about the tea. It just tastes like a weak green tea to me."

    "I guess that's what being refined is all about…"

    li "So, Hisao…"

    li "I'll be with you in a second, Miki."
    
    "Lilly carefully makes her way to the door and into the hallway, closing the door behind her."
    
    "Hanako, now slightly clamer, nurses her cup."
    
    "She swills the half-full cup gently, following the ripples in the cup with her whole head."
    
    "Out of the conrner of her eye, she spots me looking at her, and stops the swilling."
    
    hi "So, uh, how did you find studying with Lilly today?"
    
    ha "It… it was good."
    
    hi "Yeah, she's a pretty good teacher."
    
    ha "She explained everything well."

    hi "Sure, I guess."
    
    ha "A-are you sure?"
    
    hi "I don't see a problem. It's just a bit of shopping, right?"

    li "That's excellent. I'm sorry to do this to you Hisao, but I completely forgot about this meeting."
    
    hi "That's fine, I didn't really have any plans for tomorrow anyway, so it's all good."
    
    li "Thank you very much for that. Now then, what were we talking about?"

    "We whittle away evening discussing various things; just general smalltalk about life at the school."

    "I can tell that Lilly and Hanako are genuine friends, and that Lilly's kindness to Hanako is totally natural."

    "I'm also starting to understand a bit more about Hanako."

    "She's quick to become embarrassed, however it seems that, once you get past that, she's actually a fairly interesting person."

label en_H9:

    li "You're late! Penalty!"

    hi "But I've got five more minutes!"

    li "Perhaps. However, you are the last one to arrive. By definition, that makes you late."

    "What am I supposed to do? I have a feeling that arguing with Lilly is a bad idea."

    hi "Okay, fine, you're right. I'm late."

    hi "What's the punishment this time?"

    "Lilly and Hanako are standing by the gates of the school."

    "Between them stands Niji, the guide dog, who looks far too excited at the prospect of a walk."

    "I guess that a dog is more useful than a cane in the city, as opposed to the familiarity of the school."

    #I suppose the last tow lines can be dropped if they're too redundant. I just didn't' want to
    #start off with a swag of dialogue.

    li "Well, as you can clearly see, Niji will be accompanying us on this trip."

    li "Therefore, your punishment today is to escort Hanako."

    li "You are to be her knight, and protect her from all that is wrong with the world."

    li "If you fail in this task, your reparations will never cease."

    li "Do you understand?"

    "Lilly's voice drips with a strange sweetness; one that seems to be saying “Yes, I'm joking, but you'd better not test me.”"

    hi "Sure do… but if we wait here much longer, we'll miss the bus, right?"

    li "My my, you are correct. Shall we?"

    ha "I think we should."

    li "You heard your lady; now, take her to the bus stop. Niji, up!"

    "Obediently, Niji rises to his haunches and starts off at a trot."

    "As Lilly starts to follow him, I notice the subtlety behind Lilly's penalty."

    "Niji has been trained to walk at Lilly's left hand side."

    "Meaning, should Lilly and Hanako walk side-by-side, Hanako's right side would be exposed to the public."

    "I guess that means that Lilly wasn't far off; I will be shielding Hanako from the public, in a way."

    "I hurriedly take up station alongside Hanako for the short walk to the school's bus stop."

    hi "So, I guess we're together for this adventure, eh?"

    ha "Um… y… yeah. Thanks…"

    "I wonder if the two of them planned this, or if it's all Lilly…"

    "The school's bus stop is barely a hundred metres from the gates, and is little more than a shelter and a bench seat."

    "A weathered timetable shows that this route hasn't been changed in quite some time."

    "Every hour at 35 past from six to ten."

    "It makes you wonder why they even bothered printing out the two pages of timetable."

    "I just summed it up in a single line…"

    "And, right on schedule, the white-and-green bus can be seen trundling up the hill as we arrive at the stop."

    "The bus itself is empty, save the driver, so we file down the aisle to the rear bench seat."

    "I sit in the middle, with the girls flanking me, whilst Niji lays down in the aisle"

    li "So, Hisao, have you spent much time in the city here?"

    hi "Not really. I had a quick look when I first got here, but that was mostly through the car window."

    li "Well then, we'll take this opportunity to show you the sights."

    li "Isn't that right, Hanako?"

    ha "R…right. The sights…"

    "Something seems odd about that comment, even for Hanako…"

    hi "Um, is there something that I'm missing?"

    li "My my, aren't we suspicious, Hisao?"

    li "There's nothing to be afraid of, is there Hanako?"

    ha "R…right. Nothing…"

    "This does not bode well."

    hi "Last time I was reassured like this I ended up with a hangover."

    hi "You're not going to get us drunk again, are you?"

    li "My word no! I've already said I'll let you know before I do that again."

    li "Today will be nothing like that at all."

    li "I promise."

    "I'm doomed."

    "The bus ride to the city is surprisingly short, and within about a quarter of an hour, we're standing outside Sendai Station."

    #I'm still thinking that maybe we should consider changing the city same or something..

    "The crowds are phenomenal, and I can already feel Hanako moving ever closer to my side."

    "It's almost painful to watch her; she desperately wants to hide herself, but for some reason she's holding herself away from me, her only barrier."

    li "Don't forget, Hisao, that it's your duty to protect Hanako."

    li "I really don't want to be forced into action…"

    #Should we decide we need more choices in act 2, there will be one here.
    #One is to "take action" and the other will be to "hide Hanako" or seomthing.
    #basically, the "take action" will lead to this reality, whilst the other will
    #mean that you just walk between Hanako and Lilly, and hence get
    #lilly points whilst losing Hanako points.

    hi "Got ya."

    "Lilly words inspire me, and I wrap my arm around Hanako's, drawing her close to me."

    "Her immediate reaction is one of shock, however I can also feel that she's grasping onto my arm with an almighty force."

    ha "T…thanks."

    "I turn towards her, completely expecting her to be in her usual, looking-at-the-ground pose."

    "However, I'm greeted by her dainty face; her one visible eye staring straight into mine."

    hi "It…it's nothing."

    "I'm not one to stammer, but the pure relief on her face is… adorable."

    li "Come now, we don't have all night. Niji, up!"

    li "Hisao, I know where we are going, but I'll still need you to guide us to a degree."

    # I was going to put a section describing Sendai in here, but I'm not sure if it's setting the
    #scene, or simply just being filler.

    li "We're going to the store two blocks up from here, “Frommage.”"

    #I know no French. If someone could help me out here, that would be tops.

    hi "Er, I guess."

    "And with that, Lilly turns and starts to lead."

    "I'm not even sure why she gave me directions in the first place."

    "Even though the crowd seems to part for Niji and Lilly, we are moving a lot slower than usual."

    "Altogether, it's not a bad thing."

    "The warmth that is radiating into my side is entirely pleasant."

    "Hanako's grip has released a little too, so it no longer feels like she's trying to crush my arm."

    "Any casual passer by would have easily mistaken us for a couple."

    "And Hanako, now slightly more relaxed, is starting to look less like a scared puppy any more like a girl."

    ha "No…none of them are looking!"

    "The relief in her voice is astonishing."

    hi "Who's not looking?"

    ha "The people… last time we came here, everyone was looking…"

    "I look around, and notice that Hanako isn't lying."

    "In fact, it's almost the opposite; it's almost like people are deliberately looking away."

    "I guess they're just avoiding eye contact with a couple that is publicly showing affection."

    "Well, their loss. Hanako seems to have not noticed this fact, and that's probably a good thing."

    "I have a feeling she'd go redder than ever if I suggested that to her."

    "I wish I had more time to ponder this, but a brief call from Lilly brings me back to reality."

    li "That was the last intersection, Hisao. It should be here, on the right, third or fourth store up."

    #depending on the choice above (if it exists) then this will be slightly different.

    ha "It's okay, I can show you…"

    li "My my, Hanako, how rare of you to speak in the city. Well done."

    li "I guess I won't have to punish Hisao at all."

    "Thank you Hanako. Words cannot express my gratitude."

    "But, then again, a part of me was almost looking forward to the punishment…"

    "Maybe I should see a psychiatrist."

    ha "It's this one, Lilly."

    "Hanako gently tugs me towards the shops, and I realise that, quite possibly, I am about to be punished."

    hi "Wait, what is this place…?"

    li "It's a clothing shop."

    hi "I can see that… but… what type of clothing is this?"

    ha "It's mostly… um… cos…play…"

    hi "Don't tell me, you girls are…"

    li "My my, no. However, there are occasionally some interesting items in here."

    li "And I thought that, seeing as you have only recently joined us, that you might be in need of some."

    li "Especially as you seem to have made a habit of being tardy…"

    hi "Wait… what? Me? Tardy?"

    "Mental note: Never trust Lilly."

    ha "Hi…Hisao… you're making a scene… people… people… people are looking…"

    "I'm trapped. Trapped between a demon with a guide dog and a helpless victim."

    hi "Fine, let's get inside then, shall we?"

    "We make our way into the store. It's fairly open, with a number of mannequins modelling various uniforms."

    "Here, a police officer. There, a soldier."

    "Towards the back, there are a few exquisite dresses."

    "Store Owner" "Ah, Lady Satou, Lady Ikezawa, how nice to see you both!"

    "Store Owner" "And you've bought a friend!"

    "The store owner, a plum man with thin grey hair and a comb of a moustache, makes his way from behind the counter."

    "Store Owner" "Whatever brings you here today?"

    ha "Him."

    "Hanako, now safe from the crowds on the street, has relaxed to an extent."

    "I also notice that she has somewhat distanced herself from me."

    "I have a bad feeling about this…"

    "Store Owner" "Oh my, would this be the gentleman you were telling me about, Lady Satou?"

    li "You're absolutely correct, this is Hisao."

    li "He's new to town, so I thought that you might be able to help us find something… appropriate for him."

    "The store owner descends upon me like a vulture to a carcass."

    "Store Owner" "Well now, let us have a look at you then…"

    "I see why Hanako stood back now."

    "For a large man, the store owner moves fast."

    "Before I have a chance to react, he is examining my body with his tape measure."

    "Occasionally, he'll make approving clucks or snicker to himself, for reasons known only to himself."

    "The ordeal only lasts a couple of minutes, however I feel as if all my secrets have been exposed to this rotund man and his tape measure."

    "Store Owner" "Thank you for being so co-operative. I think we might be able to help you after all, Master Hisao."

    hi "Um, great, I guess."

    hi "Just one question though… What exactly is it that you do here?"

    "Store Owner" "Ah, now that's easy. I'm a tailor."

    hi "I can see that. But what, exactly, do you, er, tail?"

    #I can't remember the verb for "Make Clothes". Is it "sew"?

    "Store Owner" "Ah, now that isn't so easy."

    "Store Owner" "I guess you could say that I sew dreams together."

    "Store Owner" "My customers come to me with an idea, and I make it into reality."

    "Store Owner" "Take your friends here; they both prefer the finer things, however Lady Ikezawa has… specific tastes."

    "I glance across at Hanako, who tries to avoid my gaze."

    ha "It's… not what you think…"

    li "Yes, Hisao, don't be so hasty to judge."

    li "Master Shinji here is an excellent tailor."

    li "He makes dresses for Hanako and I, made so that Hanako needn't fear exposing her… condition… to the public."

    hi "Ah, right."

    "I suppose that makes sense."

    "I guess Hanako couldn't exactly wear any old dress without exposing her scars."

    "Store Owner" "My word yes, it is an honour to make dresses for these two lovely ladies."

    "Store Owner" "And such a pleasant departure from my normal work."

    "In saying this, Shinji the Tailor moves closer to me, and whispers in my ear."

    "Store Owner" "But, in saying that, I do have their measurements memorised."

    "Store Owner" "Should you see anything around here that piques your interest, just give me a call…"

    "Shinji gives me a pat on the shoulder, as if to reassure me."

    "And, whilst I know I shouldn't think about these types of things, I can't help but look around at the numerous outfits on display."

    li "My my, Hisao, I certainly hope that you're not thinking anything strange now."

    hi "NO! Not at all… I'm just…"

    "Lilly titters her refined laugh."

    li "It's all right Hisao. We won't divulge your secrets to others."

    "She is the devil incarnate."

    "Store Owner" "Come now, it's only natural for boys his age to be excited at such thoughts."

    "Store Owner" "For now, though, shall we get to business?"

    "Store Owner" "I believe you wanted a basic outfit for starters, but with the possibility of going for a 14-G outfit in the future?"

    "Wait what? This was pre-planned?"

    li "Yes, that is the general idea. I'd like you to organise something appropriate for summer, but if you could have “that” made up, it would be good."

    hi "Hang on… what's going on here?"

    ha "It's OK Hisao. Lilly knows what she's doing."

    hi "That's what's worrying me."

    "Store Owner" "I think I have something available off-the-shelf for the moment, but the 14-G will have a wait of about a week."

    li "That should be fine. Can we just put these on the account?"

    "Store Owner" "Most certainly, Lady Satou."

    li "Excellent. I'm looking forward to the results."

    hi "Just what the…"

    "I'm stopped dead in my track by Hanako, who grabs the back of my shirt."

    ha "Please relax, Hisao."

    ha "Everything will be fine…"

    "Store Owner" "Lady Ikezawa is correct, Master Hisao. You have nothing to fear in this shop."

    "Nothing except the three of you, you mean."

    "Store Owner" "I'll be right back with the formal wear."

    "Store Owner" "Please, feel free to take a seat, or to look around."

    "Shinji leaves with a wink, as if inviting me to pick something out."

    ha "It's not what you think, Hisao."

    ha "He makes good dresses."

    hi "Somehow I'm not sure how that's going to help me."

    li "Come now, Hisao, don't be like that."

    li "Master Shinji is amazing. You've seen his work before."

    hi "Yes, I can see it around here…"

    li "I was referring to my gown from the festival."

    hi "Oh, the blue dress?"

    "Fond memories of helping Lilly dress herself come flooding back."

    hi "That was from here?"

    li "Yes, it was. I have Shinji make special dresses that give me the freedom I need to play."

    li "He's quite amazing."

    hi "Oh, I see."

    hi "But how does that help me?"

    li "Fufufu, you'll be needing formal wear at some point, won't you?"

    li "I thought that we should organise something before it became a problem."

    li "Think of it as a gift."

    hi "Um, that sounds fair. Thanks, I guess."

    ha "Um, Lilly…"

    li "Yes, my dear?"

    ha "Should we…?"

    "I don't like where this is going."

    "Wait a minute…"

    hi "…what's a G-14?"

    "Hanako shoots a nervous glance at Lilly, who just smiles."

    li "Oh, now that is a gift from me to Hanako and myself."

    li "It's a special uniform."

    li "Don't fret, though. It will be reserved specifically for punishment."

    "I can't stand it anymore, so I start prowling the shop, looking for a G-14."

    "Master Shinji truly is an amazing tailor."

    "Every mannequin sports a different outfit; soldiers, police men and women, maid outfits, all made perfectly."

    "And, at the foot of each mannequin is a tag. Apparently a high-school uniform is an E-3."

    li "I presume that you are looking for a G-14, Hisao."

    li "You'll find them towards the rear…"

    "Immediately, I make my way to the rear of the store."

    "G-10, G-11, G-12, G-13…"

    "Finally, I stop at by a foot that reads “G-14.”"

    "Part of me doesn't want to look up, somehow hoping that refusing the existence of G-14 will save me from Lilly and Hanako."

    "But curiosity gets the better of me, and I cast my eyes skyward, examining the mannequin."

    ha "See… it's nothing to worry about…"

    "I'm not quite sure if I can take Hanako seriously."

    "On the one hand, the suit named G-14 isn't anything extraordinary like a combat tutu."

    "On the other hand, it quite clearly is a suit designed for a servant."

    li "I just felt that if you were to take up a role of servitude to us, then you should be appropriately attired."

    hi "A… butler's outfit?"

    ha "I'm sorry, Hisao."

    ha "I shouldn't have asked Lilly…"

    "Hanako? This was your idea?"

    "She seems to have followed me back here, and is now looking at me with her practiced, puppy-dog eye."

    hi "Er, I guess it's alright…"

    "Why are men such suckers for women?"

    "Damned instincts."

    ha "So… you'll wear this?"

    hi "I suppose…"

    "Hanako smiles in delight."

    ha "Lilly! He likes it!"

    li "Of course he does, Hanako."

    li "You were the one that picked it out, after all…"

    "Store Owner" "It's such a nice piece as well, and quite popular this year for some reason."

    "Store Owner" "Your taste is a splendid as always, Lady Ikezawa."

    "Store Owner" "Here you go, Master Hisao. One formal summer set, as ordered."

    "Shinji passes me an exquisitely wrapped package."

    hi "Um, thanks."

    "Store Owner" "Now, you look after the two ladies, you hear."

    "Store Owner" "They've done you a great service by introducing you to me."

    hi "Er, great. I'll keep that in mind."

    "With that, he turns towards Lilly."

    "Store Owner" "Is that all for today, Lady Satou?"

    li "Yes, Master Shinji, it is."

    li "By the by, that last dress you made was perfect."

    li "I could have been wearing nothing for the freedom it gave me."

    "I need to keep my imagination in check."

    "Store Owner" "Really? That's wonderful. I had hoped that it would be more useful than its predecessor."

    li "My my, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Even that dress was more comfortable than any other I've worn."

    li "You truly are a master."

    "Shinji takes on a girlish blush, quite unbecoming of the large man."

    "Store Owner" "Oh, come now Lady Satou, you shouldn't flatter me so! I'll get embarrassed!"

    ha "Um, the bus…"

    li "My my, already?"

    li "I'm sorry Master Shinji, but we must bid you farewell for today."

    "Store Owner" "Ah, parting is such a painful time."

    "Store Owner" "I hope to see you all again soon."

    "Store Owner" "That includes you, Master Hisao."

    hi "Um, great. I hope to see you again too…"

    ha "See you, Shinji."

    "Store Owner" "You all be careful now. Look after them, Master Hisao…"

    "With the extended farewells said, we finally leave Shinji's odd store."

    "No sooner have we hit the footpath, Hanako is once again burying herself into my side."

    "I can't believe that, less than ten minutes ago, she was able to manipulate me into wearing a butler's outfit."

    hi "Hanako?"

    ha "Mmmm"

    "Her response is barely audible on the busy street."

    hi "Do you really want me to dress up like that, or was it Lilly's idea?"

    ha "…"

    "I can't hear her mumbled response, but the look on her face gives her away."

    hi "Hmm. I guess it's ok then."

    hi "But I'm not doing it in public."

    "Once again, Hanako's mumbled reply is lost to the noise of the street, but she does smile at me."

    "Ahead of us, Lilly and Niji seem to walk confidently through the city."

    "In fact, it looks as if Lilly knows her way around these streets as well as she knows her way around the school."

    "I wonder, was it really necessary for her to even bring Niji?"

    "Then again, without Niji's presence, I wouldn't have been able to walk around with Hanako."

    "Our arrival at the station's bus stop cuts off any further thoughts on this subject."

    "Once again, we are the only people on the bus to the school."

    "I'm at a loss for words. Too much has happened in too short a time for my brain to comprehend."

    "It seems to be the same for Lilly and Hanako."

    "Lilly is looking content with herself, as if she's accomplished some huge task."

    "Hanako, on the other hand, looks too excited for words. About what, I can't tell, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it involves a certain “me” and a certain “outfit.”"

    "At the school, we part ways with a brief farewell."

    "Starved, I head for the Great Hall for dinner, and I see the girls make their way towards the dorms and, inevitably, Niji's kennel."

    "I can't help but feel that maybe, just maybe, I've bitten off more than I can chew with those two girls."

    "The days are really starting to heat up."

    "This morning, I awoke covered in sweat, which is a little disappointing if you're alone."

    "Still by the time the student body starts leaving the dorms to find their breakfasts and morning duties, the sun has well and truly, and for some reason, that puts me in high spirits."

    "It's not even 8am, yet I feel that the day is going to be one of those pleasant, albeit slightly warm ones."

    "If I weren't at a school that considered every absence from class a sign of a life-threatening situation, I'd consider skipping the whole day and just relaxing on the hill near the track."

    "Yes, today will be a genuinely lazy day."

    "It seems that I'm not alone in my desires."

    "I catch nearly every member of the class glancing through the window and into the tantalizing sky."

    "Even the steadfast Shizune seems to lack her usual vigour for schoolwork."

    "Misha, as uncouth as ever, has even loosened her tie and is trying to secretly fan air down the front of her shirt."

    "I must have been staring, as she's now poking her tongue out at me."

    "However, she shows no signs of slowing her efforts, nor is she trying to hide the fact."

    "How pleasant."

    "The lunch bells seem to catch everyone by surprise, and the class empties at a much slower pace than usual."

    "The heat seems to be draining the will to rush from everyone."

    "Well, almost everyone."

    ha "H… Hisao?"

    hi "My dear Hanako, what can I do for you today?"

    "Hanako already has her small lunch-bag in hand."

    "I don't have to be a scholar to work out where this is going."

    ha "Um… would you like to have lunch with us again?"

    hi "Of course. You know, you don't have to ask politely every time."

    hi "It's becoming a bit of a routine, you know?"

    ha "Ah… right."

    hi "I take it we're going to the roof?"

    ha "P…please."

    ha "Lilly said she'll join us up there, so we should… should…"

    hi "Should?"

    ha "…should go ahead together…"

    "I'm not entirely sure where this is going, but, seeing as we're at school, I doubt Lilly's antics can go too far here."

    #I'm basing this on the fact that, whilst there is no "Evil" lilly (She was neve veil in my
    #books…), she will still have some kind of obvious influence on the events to date.

    hi "Sounds like a plan. This heat has made me pretty hungry."

    "Hanako breathes a sigh of relief, and I gather my things together."

    "The door, as always, is unlocked, and it yields itself to a glorious view of summer's clear blue skies."

    "The usual din of the school seems to be a bit subdued today; mostly likely laziness spurred on by heat exhaustion."

    "Shimmering waves of heat rise from the roof, refracting the chicken-wire fence into a lurid blur of lines."

    hi "Let's, ah, sit in the shade of the stairwell, eh?"

    ha "O…okay."

    "Due to the high angle of the sun, even the stairwell housing casts precious little shadow onto the roof."

    "However, it is surprising cool in the little pool of shade, with a light breeze cooling us even more."

    "Hanako slowly spreads out her food, focussing intently on every little movement, as if she's trying to keep her mind off something else."

    "By the time she's done, there's only space left for herself and I in the shade."

    hi "Heh, it's a good thing Lilly isn't here yet…"

    ha "EHH!?"

    "Hanako jumps as if stuck by lightning, sending a light shower of rice over the two of us."

    ha "W…www…what do you mean?"

    ha "Sorry!"

    ha "I … I mean… sorry… but… whatdoyoumean?"

    hi "Er… I was just going to say that there's no more shade up here…"

    "I slowly start picking grains of rice off my shirt."

    ha "Oh… oh… she'll… she'll be here soon…"

    "Hanako quickly looks around, like a meercat on steroids."

    "She seems to have totally missed the fact that she wore more rice than I did."

    hi "Here, you should clean that off before it dries…"

    "I lean over and lightly brush some rice off her shoulder."

    ha "Udurp!"

    "Hanako makes a sound that's half word, half sharp inhalation and half squeal."

    "I doubt any explanation on earth would suffice."

    "Nevertheless, I retract my hand, and she hurriedly brushes herself down."

    hi "Sorry, I didn't mean to…"

    ha "It's alright. Alright…"

    hi "Right… well… do you want some more food, considering your, er, loss?"

    "Somehow, Hanako manages to go another shade redder."

    "I'm sure modern physicians would be amazed by the wonders of the Hanako Blush."

    ha "I'm f…fine."

    ha "…thanks."

    "For the time being, we simply eat our food in silence."

    "With time, the blood drains from Hanako's face, and it returns to its base, pinkish state."

    "A few clouds punctuate the otherwise clear sky, and gently drift towards the city's airspace."

    "It's so peaceful that I almost miss the fact that we are still alone."

    hi "Do you think that something's wrong?"

    ha "What do you mean?"

    hi "Well, Lilly isn't here yet…"

    "Hanako nearly chokes on a bite of her omelette."

    "A few coughs and an apology later, Hanako seems able to speak again."

    ha "She… er… she… um… she might…not… be coming."

    #Lol Aura have an ellipsis :p

    hi "Eh? Why not? *Is* there's something wrong?"

    ha "Um, no. She's fine."

    ha "I'm fine."

    ha "You're… you're… fine…"

    hi "Then what's up?"

    "Hanako inhales sharply, pulls her shoulders back, and forces her eyes shut."

    ha "S—s—she… um… said she might… have to check on Niji, and that it might take some time, and that she might not make it, and that we should not fret and that we should stay here and that we should not look for her and that we should relax and that we should not get too nervous."

    #What I'd *really* like would be for Hanako to go from a kinda determined sprite into a
    # *really* determined, eyes-closed-with-the-effort-and-clenched-fists kinda sprite half-
    #way through that line. Is that possible? If not, let me know and I'll just describe it.

    "I think those last two points were possibly lost on Hanako."

    hi "Um… okay…"

    "Hanako inhales for the first time in what seems like minutes, then slowly releases her breath, her body unclenching as it does so."

    "She repeats this a few times, almost as if she's been trained to do so."

    "Eventually, she opens her eyes, apparently once again in a state of normality."

    hi "Feeling better?"

    ha "A bit…"

    hi "So Lilly probably isn't coming?"

    ha "No…"

    hi "So we're alone up here?"

    "Hanako gulps."

    ha "Y… yea…"

    hi "Lilly was right…"

    ha "EH?"

    hi "You should relax."

    "For some reason, Hanako's tension seems to break, and, if I'm not wrong, she even laughs a little."

    ha "I… I should… yeah…"

    "Hanako closes her eyes, and takes one more of her deep breaths, her hands upon her chest."

    "Once she is done, she opens her eyes again, and smiles gently."

    ha "Sorry… I kinda freaked out a bit there…"

    "The transition into the more confident Hanako goes almost unnoticed as she leans against the wall of the stairwell."

    ha "Ah… it's cool… you should try this…"

    "I lean back against the stairwell wall, and feel the cool cement through my thin cotton shirt."

    hi "You're right… this is good…"

    ha "I guess this side doesn't see the sun til late afternoon, so it makes sense…"

    hi "Yeah…"

    "For a while, we do nothing but gaze into the sapphire blue of the sky as it reaches out across the school and beyond."

    "Small, puffy clouds form and slowly disappear before our eyes, but that doesn't seem to matter."

    "Simply sitting here, the two of us alone, seems to be enough."

    "The bells, much closer here than elsewhere, rouse us from our reveries."

    "Once again, the urge to skip class rises in my gut."

    "I shoot a glance at Hanako, who shows no signs of moving either."

    ha "Not… just yet…"

    "The interval between the warning bells and the end of lunch bells passes in the blink of an eye."

    hi "We really should go… people will freak out and start a search party if we skip…"

    "Hanako sighs."

    ha "You're right."

    "Slowly, she raises herself to her feet, and I follow suit."

    "Silently, we make our way down the old stairs to the third floor of the school building, and then to our classroom."

    "At the door, I take point, and open the door ahead of Hanako, bowing my head down in apology in advance."

    hi "I'm sorry we're late, teacher."

    "I am greeted not by stern words, nor an angered instruction to take my seat, but simply the silence created by twenty or so students trying not to laugh."

    mi "Pff… pffwa…"

    "Make that about nineteen students trying, and one student failing."

    mi "pftBwahahaha! The lovers return!"

    "I can tell exactly what's going on before I even raise my head."

    "Muto, ever tardy, is yet to arrive."

    "However, the fact that Hanako and I have arrived together is blatantly obvious."

    mi "WHAHAHAHA!"

    hi "Yeah, thanks. You can calm down now…"

    "I step into the door, and realise that Hanako is pressed almost firmly against my back, hiding herself from the class."

    "As I near my seat, she makes a bolt for her desk at the back of the class and hides her face in her arms."

    "Quickly checking the door for any signs of imminent teacher arrival, I make a trip to Hanako's desk, and whisper in her exposed ear."

    hi "Don't worry about Misha, she's always like this."

    hi "I enjoyed myself today."

    hi "You should just relax, 'kay?"

    "Hanako nods here head into her folded arms, but doesn't show her face."

    "I yearn to stay and console her more, but Muto picks this exact moment to enter the class, half-way through his lecture, as if he started it in the hallway."

    mu "…which, of course, is directly proportional to the charge but inversely proportionally to the square of the distance…"

    "He's so engrossed in his speech that he doesn't even notice me sneaking back into my seat from Hanako's desk."

    #Some sort of passage of time should be shown here.

    "The bells ring, and not a moment too soon."

    "I have an overwhelming urge to use the lavatory, and, for once, am the first person out of the classroom."

    "However, it appears that I am not the first person in the hallways, as I run headlong into Lilly."

    hi "Lilly! Sorry! I was just on my way to…"

    li "That's perfectly alright, I was in a hurry as well, and should have taken more time."

    li "Tell me, though, did you have a good time?"

    hi "Eh?"

    li "Today, at lunch. Did you enjoy yourself?"

    hi "Um… yeah…"

    "The pressure in my bladder is building, but I can't find a way to tell Lilly that…"

    li "That's good to hear. I had a feeling it would work out for the best."

    li "But, please tell me, is there any reason you're abandoning Hanako now then?"

    hi "Wha? Abandon? No… I… I just… I need to…"

    "My leg has started shaking uncontrollably. Must not think of waterfalls, must not think of waterfa… DAMNIT!"

    li "Fufufu, I think I understand, Hisao. I'll pass on your apologies to Hanako; I was on my way to see her anyway."

    hi "Thanks…"

    "I barely finish my reply before bolting down the hallway to the bathrooms."

    "Behind me, I can hear Lilly laughing amid the sounds of the classrooms around us emptying."

    "It's a leisurely stroll around the campus at night. A cool breeze wafts across the path, gently shaking the branches of the trees overhead."

    "I wander aimlessly, content simply to soak up the atmosphere of the school."

    "Truthfully, I haven't had the time to do so yet."

    "Thinking that she might be onto something, I close my eyes, and try to focus only on the sounds around us."

    "The little creek bubbles slightly, and the breeze whistles through the trees."

    "A lone cicada, seemingly not realising that the sun has gone down, chirps in the distance."

    hi "Are you right to go back to your room alone?"

    "Lilly stands, and Niji, sensing the movement, springs to her side."

    li "My my, aren't you perceptive tonight?"

    li "If you hurry, you should catch Hanako on her way to get you now."

    hi "Er, right. I'll see you there then…"

    "Lilly gives me a brisk little wave, and then I'm off as fast as my chest will allow."

    "As I approach my dorm, I see a figure wrapped in a cloak of indecisiveness pacing around the front door."

    "There can be no doubt as to who it is, but I can't help but hide and observe for a second."

    "Hanako seems to wander around for a moment, then builds up her resolve, and strikes out for the door."

    "Yet, every time she touches the door handle, she recoils, as if convinced that it's a bad idea to go inside."

    "I've only been here a little over a fortnight and even I know there's really no rule about going in and out of the dorms."

    "I guess it must just be hard for her."

    hi "Sounds good. Shall we, or did you need to get something from inside?"

    ha "N…n…no…"

    hi "Come on then, let's go."

    ha "'kay."

    "It's only a short walk to the girl's dorm, which is a shame."

    "There's something about walking along with Hanako that just feels… right."

    "We barely share a word, and it's not like we're holding hands or such, but there's just that feeling of being at ease."

    "I can sense a slight change in Hanako as well."

    "She's not shuffling her feet, nor is she stooping her head."

    "She's just walking along calmly, hands held together at her waist, looking absently around."

    "But, all good things must come to an end, and in what seems like an instant, we're at Lilly's door."

    "Hanako taps gently on the door, but there's no reply from within."

    ha "Oh… Lilly said she was taking Niji for a walk…"

    "I nearly slap myself in the face for this; there's no way Lilly could have made it back yet."

    "Besides, we would have seen her making her way back if she were here yet."

    hi "Ah, well… what do we do… hey wait…!"

    "Before I can finish my sentence, Hanako pushes open Lilly's door."

    ha "Eh? But she's not here, so there's no problem, right?"

    hi "Um, I'm not sure if that's the right attitude…"

    "Hanako looks a little confused."

    ha "But she was expecting us, so it's OK, right?"

    "I get the feeling that arguing the point would be futile."

    "Plus, Lilly is the type to overlook an intrusion such as this."

    hi "I suppose your right, but we should at least start getting things ready for her."

    "Hanako nods in agreement, steps into the room, and starts boiling the small kettle."

    "Not really knowing what to do, I seat myself at the table, and watch Hanako."

    "I know that making tea isn't exactly the most exciting activity to watch, but there's something about the meticulous way Hanako moves that makes it impossible for me to look away."

    "Every move seems to be considered before it is executed; a strange moderation that must have been borne of years of hiding half her body."

    "Watching her, I hardly even notice the passage of time, and it seems like the little teapot is on the table within seconds of us entering the room."

    hi "Er, thanks."

    ha "Not at all…"

    "We sip our tea in silence, and I'm starting to wonder just where Lilly has gotten to."

    ha "Um, Hisao?"

    "The sudden breaking of the silence startles me into spilling a little of my tea."

    hi "YesHOT!"

    "I quickly put the cup down and shake the hot liquid off my hands."

    hi "Before?"

    ha "Well, next week is Lilly's birthday. She hasn't told anyone, but I want to hold a party for her."

    hi "That sounds like a great idea! We could invite a lot of people, and go to…"

    ha "I don't think she wants many people to know."

    hi "Eh?"

    ha "She rarely mentions it to anyone."

    hi "Well, I guess that's fair enough."

    hi "What did you have in mind?"

    "It would appear that the “calm” that my accident instilled has run out."

    ha "Um… well, if it's okay with you… I'd like to… I was thinking about…"

    hi "Yes?"

    ha "W…would you like some tea Lilly?"

    ha "It should still be warm…"

    li "That would be lovely, Hanako."

    "Lilly seats herself at the table, and Hanako pours her a cup of tea."

    hi "So… how was your walk?"

    li "It was most enjoyable. There was a beautiful breeze blowing tonight."

    li "You really should try it sometime; walking through the gardens at night."

    "I'm certain that if it were possible, Lilly would wink at me at this instant."

    hi "Um, I'll try to keep that in mind."

    "I go to take another sip of tea, only to find that my cup is empty."

    ha "Oh, would you like some more?"

    hi "I would, but I don't think that the tea is agreeing with me tonight."

    li "My my, is something the matter? Should we try a different tea?"

    hi "No, that's not it. Your tea attacked me earlier is all."

    li "Oh. I don't quite understand, but I'll take your word for it."

    hi "Anyway, I best be off."

    hi "I'll see you in class tomorrow, Hanako."

    ha "Y… yeah. Can we discuss… that assignment then?"

    hi "Sure thing. See you later Lilly, thanks for the viscous tea."

    li "I'm not sure if you're insulting me there, but you are welcome."

    hi "Later."

    "Yet again, my night finishes far too late."

    "And I haven't even finished my homework."

    "Even so, I much rather prefer spending my time with the girls."

    "Since I've met them, I've noticed changes in them both."

    "Lilly seems to act more freely, and Hanako is far more relaxed."

    "And, to be honest, I don't really mind the games, or the late nights."

    "As per usual, the boy's dorm is silent as I make my way back to my room."

    "I guess not everyone is as neglectful of their studies and sleep as we are."

    "I raise my head from my desk, only to see Misha's face about half a foot from mine, only she's looking at Shizune furiously carving the air with her signing."

    mi "Muto has called in ill today, so we're running a study period."

    hi "You are? As in, you two?"

    mi "Yup! Great, innit?"

    mi "Anyway, we're off."

    hi "Wha? Off? But you just…"

    mi "Whahaha Hisao! We're going to the council office!"

    mi "There's tea and biscuits there! Like we'd stay here when there's nothing to do!"

    mi "Whahahahah~"

    "I'm sure that something has leaked into Misha's brain and made her incapable of feeling tired."

    "Or make any sense, for that matter."

    "Probably all of that “talking for two” that she does."

    mi "You should have joined us~! Now you're all alone~!"

    "Shizune gives me a polite wave before following the skipping Misha out into the corridor."

    "And it's not just them."

    "Half the class seems to have taken their leave from this teacherless class."

    "I suppose there isn't that much of a chance to skip classes here. It's not like you can call in sick or just stay at home."

    "Dorm life can be hard, sometimes."

    ha "Y…you're not leaving, Hisao?"

    "Hanako's voice drifts over my shoulder."

    "Without me even noticing, she's moved to stand directly behind me."

    "I guess constantly being the silent type has extended even into her movements…"

    hi "Oh, morning Hanako."

    hi "I figured I could use this chance to maybe do some of the homework I missed last night."

    ha "Eh? Really?"

    "I stifle a laugh."

    hi "Of course not! I haven't had a chance to skip classes in months! It's a golden opportunity!"

    #downcast Hanako

    ha "O…oh…"

    hi "You wanna come too?"

    #Hanako brighter

    ha "Sure…"

    hi "Besides, I wanted to talk to you about Lilly's party."

    ha "Sure…"

    "I get the feeling that I won't get much more out of her in the classroom, so we head for the roof."

    "As soon as we get through the door to the stone-covered roof, Hanako breaks into a run for the fence."

    "In doing so, her hair is caught by the wind, and streams out behind her, like some kind of banner."

    "She hits the rusty wire fence with full force, causing entire sections of the barrier to shriek in tension."

    hi "Er, isn't that dangerous?"

    ha "Oh… I'd never fall. The fence is here, isn't it?"

    "That was my point… whatever…"

    hi "You're right. Anyway, about Lilly's party…"

    "Hanako, still clutching the fence, looks back over her shoulder at me."

    ha "Oh yeah. Sorry… I forgot about that when I felt this breeze…"

    "I make my way across the roof to where Hanako is standing."

    "She's right though, the breeze up here is amazing, and you can see all the way into the town from here."

    hi "You mentioned karaoke last night… are you sure you want to do that?"

    #Hanako blush

    ha "Y…ye… if you don't mind…"

    hi "Just the three of us? Or should we invite others?"

    "Hanako inspects the ground for a moment before shaking her head."

    ha "Just us."

    hi "Just us it is then."

    #hanako relieved

    ha "Good. I know a place…"

    "For some reason, that doesn't surprise me."

    ha "Lilly and I have been there before."

    hi "I see. So, when should we tell her?"

    #Hanako fidget

    ha "I was thinking… that we should surprise her."

    hi "Eh? How are we going to manage that?"

    ha "Well, I was thinking we shouldn't tell her anything ."

    ha "Then, we get in a car and just… go there."

    hi "Wait, car? Go there?"

    ha "I've saved a bit of money for this."

    ha "I thought we could hire a cab."

    ha "That way, Lilly wouldn't know where we were going until we got there."

    hi "Ah, I see. I guess it would be pretty confusing in a car if you couldn't see where you were going…"

    "For a moment, we fall silent, as if paying homage to Lilly's eyesight."

    hi "Say… wouldn't it be nice to stay up here all day?"

    "Before answering, Hanako looks out through the fence again."

    ha "I think… that I could stay here forever."

    "There's part of me that understands where Hanako is coming from."

    "Up here, there's rarely anyone else, but you can still feel like you're part of the school"

    "It's like a private viewing box onto other's daily lives."

    "But this is the first time I've been up here whilst everyone else was in class."

    "Normally, all you can hear from here is the hubbub of the students in the quadrangle."

    "Now, all that can be heard are the sounds of nature from the surrounding woodlands, punctuated occasionally by a teacher's voice echoing from an open window."

    "I take a moment to just soak in the atmosphere."

    hi "Say, Hanako, have you been up here at times like these before?"

    ha "Yes."

    hi "Really? Is that why you were so excited when we got up here?"

    ha "Yes. I used to come here all the time during class."

    hi "Eh? So there were a lot of study periods before I came here?"

    ha "No. I used to skip out a lot."

    ha "I couldn't stand being in class."

    ha "At least, not until recently."

    hi "Oh, I see."

    #I originally had a bit here with Hanako acting a bit more forward, but then
    #I thought about all the "OOC!!!!" complaints… geh.

    hi "Still, I guess there will be times like this occasionally, right?"

    "Hanako sighs."

    ha "Right."

    "I glance over my shoulder at the school's clocktower."

    hi "Say… it's almost the end of homeroom; we should be headed ba…"

    "I start to step away from the fence, but before I know it, Hanako has grasped my right hand in both of hers."

    ha "Let's stay here."

    hi "Eh? H…Hanako?"

    #Hanako embarrassed

    ha "I… er… I mean… we don't have to go back yet, do we?"

    ha "First period hasn't started, right?"

    #Hanako Helpless (if we have one)

    ha "We can stay up here longer, right?"

    "I just can't say no, it's almost like she begging not to be taken back to the class."

    hi "Okay. We'll stay up here for a little…"

    mi "FOUND YOU~!"

    "The door to the stairwell flies open to reveal a panting Misha."

    mi "Shizune says “See, I told you they were up here…” um… I mean… hold on…"

    "Misha turns to face back into the stairwell, obviously to converse with a hidden Shizune."

    mi "What? Oh, right. Get back to class!"

    mi "Everyone's been looking for you!"

    mi "You're lucky the police weren't called!"

    hi "Eh? What are you talking about? You're the ones that were supposed to run the class!"

    mi "Supposed to but didn't! And now everyone thinks you're keeled over in a toilet somewhere!"

    hi "Wouldn't that make it your fault then?"

    "Misha looks confused, yet she's obviously having her anger fuelled by Shizune."

    mi "That doesn't matter! We found a substitute teacher so we have to get back to class."

    mi "Now!"

    hi "Alright, I've got you. Looks like we can't stay here forever, Hanako…"

    "Misha's eyes widen, as if she's only just noticed Hanako holding my hand."

    mi "Eeeeeeh? You were doing… this? And that? When did you get here, Hana-chin?"

    "Hana-chin? I think Misha's brain has gone into meltdown."

    "As I'm contemplating this, Misha's body convulses, as if hit by a blunt object from behind."

    "She turns to face down the stairs again, nods a few times, then spins with amazing speed back towards us."

    mi "Um, I'm not sure how well this will translate…"

    "She takes a deep breath…"

    mi "GETINTOTHECLASSROOMNOWBEFOREIMAKEYOUREGRETIT!"

    "I feel Hanako jump as Misha launches into her tirade."

    "It would appear that sign language is much more emotive and powerful than I first thought."

    hi "Okay okay, we've got you."

    mi "We? Are you two “we” now?"

    hi "Er… no… I meant…"

    ha "We… we should just go…"

    "With that, Hanako releases my hand, pushes past Misha, and heads towards the classroom."

    "Misha looks confused, if not a bit remorseful."

    mi "Um… sorry?"

    mi "But are you two… really… I mean, she's cute but… you know, in the head?"

    "Misha raps her temples, as if to illustrate her point."

    hi "You don't know what you're talking about. Excuse me…"

    "I too push past Misha."

    "As expected, Shizune is standing behind her in the gloom of the stairwell."

    "She gives me a disapproving look as I pass, but one that is tempered with a look that says “I guess this is really my fault.”"

    "And there's no way that she could have known what just happened, so I can't really hold her accountable."

    "But I'm still pissed off."

    "I guess there's no helping that."

    "You'd think that, in a school like this, that people would be more accepting of people like Hanako."

    "Inside the classroom, Hanako is curled up on her desk, hiding herself from everyone."

    "This time, I don't hesitate to approach her, even though the substitute teacher is writing something on the board."

    "I bend down, and whisper in her ear."

    hi "Hey, don't worry about them. At lunch, let's go somewhere, alone, and talk more about Lilly's party, 'kay?"

    "Hanako doesn't say anything, but nods her head further into her shoulders."

    "Before returning to my desk, I give her a light pat on her head."

    "I'm not sure if it's appropriate, but Hanako seems to react well to it."

    "Now, if I can only weather the next couple of hours until lunch…"

    nk "Come on, there may be some people who actually need my help this afternoon. Go!"

    "We step out into the hall, and the door slides shut behind us."

    hi "So… where too now?"

    "Hanako is stunned into silence, her face a picture of disbelief."

    "Her lips flap at the air, like a fish out of water, yet finally she manages to form audible words."

    "The lunch period is yet to end, so there are people moving throughout the school."

    "We should make a move now, before it becomes obvious that we are walking around."

    "I dump our bags unceremoniously in my room, grab some snacks from my stash, and take Hanako to the Green Door in the school's outer wall."

    hi "If we leave through here no-one will notice."

    "Hanako nods in agreement, and we push through the door."

    "We walk a little ways into the woods behind the school to a grassy clearing, and sit down."

    hi "This looks like a good a spot as any. Do you want some of these?"

    "I offer Hanako some of the potato snacks I brought along, which she timidly accepts."

    "In the distance, the school bells chime, and I almost get up out of habit."

    "Hanako, however, doesn't even seem to notice."

    "She just munches on the potato snacks, staring at the ground."

    ha "W—w—w—what are y—y—y—ou mean?"

    #sic.
    #Lilly surprised.

    li "My my Hanako, I was only referring to your “we” and “us.”"

    #Is Lilly psychic or something, or is it her Mary Sue flaring up again?

    li "But, if your reaction were any indication, I can only suspect you further…"

    hi "Eh, well… It's nothing, really… well… not nothing, but…"

    "Thankfully, the taxi Hanako ordered chooses this instant to arrive."

    li "Ah, saved by the cab. I'll let you two off the hook for now."

    "The cab pulls up to the bus stop, and the doors open."

    "Cab Driver" "Ikezawa and company?"

    hi "That's us."

    "I help Lilly into the car, and then sit in the front seat."

    "Hanako, still redder than a tomato, slides around to the far side of the car and closes the door behind her."

    "I can't see her face clearly, but I could have sworn I saw her smiling."

    "Cab Driver" "Where are you off to, mate?"

    ha "Shibuki Karaoke, please."

    "Hanako's sudden response surprises me; I guess she's had this planned for so long that she feels confident enough to direct the cab."

    "Cab Driver" "Sure thing."

    "We spend the short cab ride in silence."

    "There's something about having a conversation in a cab that puts me on edge, so I can only imagine how Hanako feels."

    "Lilly seems to be content to just sit in the car and grin softly to herself."

    "We arrive on a side street in the town, where a flashing LED sign proudly proclaims “Karaoke.”"

    "Hanako takes out a small change purse from her handbag and silently pays the cab driver."

    "Moments later, we are alone on the street."

    hi "Well, shall we?"

    li "By all means, please."

    "Lilly and Hanako link arms, and I open the sliding door for them."

    #I'm thinking some kind of fat + apron + kind person for the Karaoke Owner.
    #Kinda like the big dorm leader girl in Blue Drop.

    "Karaoke Woman" "Ah, Miss Satou, Miss Ikezawa, welcome back."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Is this your friend?"

    ha "Y…yes. Is our room… ready?"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Of course! Right this way. Do you want any drinks?"

    li "We should be fine for the moment, but if you could bring us some glasses, that would be splendid."

    "The club owner stops and gives Lilly and Hanako a knowing look."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Well well, I take it you've brought your own refreshments again?"

    li "Fufufu. This is a celebration, after all…"

    "The owner laughs a hearty laugh, which reverberates in the small entrance way."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Well, who am I to interfere then? Just don't get too carried away."

    "The owner then sets off down the hall, beckoning us to follow her."

    "She slides open the last door, and ushers us inside."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Here you go, room seven, just as you requested it."

    "Karaoke Woman" "I'll be back in a second with some glasses; when you're feeling a little peckish, just give me a call and I'll bring the food."

    li "Thank you, as always."

    "We step inside, and the owner slides the door shut behind us."

    hi "Er, Lilly… by “refreshments,” does she mean…"

    "Before I can finish my sentence, Lilly has withdrawn a long, green bottle from the gift bag."

    li "Fufufu, I guess that's a yes."

    li "My father sent me this for my birthday, I wanted to share it with you."

    #Shouldn't this cause some sort of trouble since the drinking age in Japan is 20 and the three are drinking in a public place; or perhaps her Mary Sue lovable personality is making it so she's on ultra good terms with the bar? Also, wouldn't this create a minor paradox since Lilly wanted to keep her drunkiness from the yacht a secret, but yet she receives alcohol from her father? Maybe I'm missing something though…

    "Hanako looks at the bottle in fear."

    "I guess this was the “again” that she mentioned on the yacht, when Lilly spiked our drinks."

    "I can imagine Lilly ordering some strange cocktail and forcing Hanako to drink it here, away from the prying eyes of society."

    "To be honest, I'm also feeling a little skeptical…"

    "Lilly must have sensed the tension in the silence, as her bright expression fades slightly."

    li "Come now, it's champagne. Moët, even! It's good, and not like rum."

    li "Please, have a glass…"

    ha "M…maybe just one…"

    hi "I guess it can't be helped…"

    "The door to the room slides open, and the owner appears with four wine glasses."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Ah, rats. I figured it was going to be wine, not champers."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Still, these should be fine, right?"

    "She hands a glass to Lilly, who gingerly feels her way around the curves of the glass."

    li "Yes, this should be fine."

    li "Would you like a glass, too?"

    "Karaoke Woman" "You bet I do. Not often that we see a bottle of that stuff “round these parts."

    li "Then could I bother you to pour?"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Too easy!"

    "With that, the owner swiftly pops the cork on the bottle and pours the four glasses."

    "We each grasp our glass, and raise it to meet Lilly's."

    hi "To Lilly!"

    ha "Happy Birthday, Lilly…"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Bottom's up!"

    li "My my, thank you all. Please, drink up!"

    "I take a cautious sip of the champagne; it fizzes gently in my mouth, and before I know it, I've drained my glass."

    hi "That's pretty good. Then again, I would expect only the best from you, Lilly."

    ha "I like it too, Lilly…"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Just as I thought, you've got good taste, girl. Well, thanks, but I'll leave you to it."

    "The owner steps out of the room and closes the door behind her."

    ha "Well, shall we? You should go first Lilly; what do you want to sing?"

    li "Hmm… I'll let you pick, Hanako. Sometimes, you seem to know more about my tastes than I."

    "Now there's a revelation."

    "But I guess that Hanako is into all of that current music-type stuff, probably more so than Lilly with her classical background."

    "Hanako picks up the controller, and whizzes through the menus like a professional."

    "In moments, there is a healthy queue of songs, some of which I've never even knew of, let alone heard."

    "I'm spellbound, and can do naught but pour another round of champagne as I watch her furiously tap the controller."

    ha "There… I think that's most of the normal ones. Here you are, Lilly…"

    "Hanako passes Lilly a mic, and then settles down on the couch between Lilly and I."

    "Only now that the excitement of arriving has died down do I notice that the seating here is rather… cozy."

    "I feel Hanako's thigh unintentionally press against mine."

    "Glancing in her direction, I see that she is intently focussed on Lilly, who is now holding the mic to her lips."

    li "I wonder what you've chosen for me this time, Hanako?"

    #Must resist urge to Kana, kana? Lilly.

    "Lilly's voice sounds strange through the Karaoke speakers; even I can tell that there's some serious Studio Magic at work here."

    "Hanako giggles, but only for an instant."

    "Even so, I can feel her shudder through our connected legs."

    ha "I think you'll know it, Lilly."

    "The menu on the screen fades away, to be replaced with a title screen for some song I've never heard."

    "Music pumps through the small speakers, a fast-paced, almost techno beat."

    "Seconds later, and without the aid of the lyrics on the screen, Lilly launches into her rendition."

    #It's the Kiddy Grade 2 OP theme, if anyone's interested.
    #It's playing on my main box now.

    #Oh ho ho… how does a Lilly know what animu is? Wait, it's her M.S. right?

    "As expected, Lilly's voice is right on tone, and she seems thoroughly engrossed in the song."

    "I suppose all of her music training has uses beyond the stage…"

    "I remember the glass of champagne I poured earlier, and lean forward to retrieve it from the table."

    "Leaning back into the couch, I feel myself press against Hanako."

    "I lurch forward off her, fully expecting her to jump away and retreat into herself."

    hi "Er, sorry."

    ha "N… not at all."

    "Although it sounds like Hanako, she makes no move to back away."

    "Lilly continues to belt out her tune, blissfully aware of the current situation."

    "Hanako calls out to me over the music, which has taken a turn towards “11.”"

    #Cheap pop-culture joke that may piss off the weeaboo and even fits the genre. Y/N?

    ha "Could you pass me my glass?"

    "I go to call back to her, but realize it would be far easier to simply hand her the glass."

    "For a second time, I lean back into the couch."

    "Now it's more than our thighs touching; I could swear that Hanako is leaning into my side."

    "However, now that I am settled once more, she seems to be avoiding eye contact with me; she looks only at Lilly, and occasionally sipping on her glass."

    "I can't complain though. This is the closest I've been to Hanako since the trip to Master Shinji's store, and I'm thoroughly enjoying every minute."

    "A faint mist starts to cover my thoughts… it must be the champagne kicking in."

    "I've heard it's faster acting than most other liquors."

    "Now that I think about it, the other two seem to be showing the early warning signs of intoxication as well."

    "Lilly is starting to move with the music, half-standing for the crescendos in her singing and a slight blush appearing on her cheeks."

    "Hanako, on the other hand, actually takes a moment to turn and look at me."

    "She's grinning like an idiot, and her cheeks are fully flushed."

    "Lilly's song comes to an explosive end, and Hanako and I quickly put our glasses down to applaud her."

    "The girls turn to me, and Lilly holds out the mic."

    li "Your turn, Hisao!"

    "I can see that Lilly has been fully charged by the combination of the alcohol and the singing."

    "I take the mic from her, and she instantly begins feeling around for her glass, which Hanako hands to her."

    hi "Well, I'm not going to promise anything… wait… what song is this?"

    "The title on the screen is nothing that I've ever seen before."

    "“Bad Apple?” It sounds like some kind of foreign song…"

    #Alstromeria Records. Fugen awesome track. I desire Hanako to sing it to me eternally.

    hi "I've never heard of this in my life!"

    "Hanako and Lilly look at me as if I've just disproved the Theory of Gravity."

    ha "Well… if you don't mind… may I?"

    "Hanako holds out her hand gingerly, and I place the mic in it."

    "That simple act seems to transform Hanako."

    "She quickly finishes off her drink just as music fills the room once more."

    "Once again, it's a high-energy song, probably more at place in a club than a karaoke bar."

    "The intro seems to go forever, but then there is a change in the intensity of the music, and the words appear on the screen…"

    "…"

    "I am entranced."

    "Hanako jumps up, mic in hand…"

    "She's holding it upside down, pointing it at her mouth, staring the screen down as if it were her mortal enemy."

    "The intensity picks up again, and Hanako start to sing."

    "Words flow out at a pace well beyond human understanding, but from what I'm hearing, Hanako doesn't miss a beat."

    "But, there's something… other worldly about the song."

    "Unlike Lilly's singing, which seemed to be melodic, Hanako's is mechanical."

    "I suppose it fits the song, which is that mechanical, rhythmic song, but I wouldn't call it… impressive."

    "But the passion that Hanako is putting into the performance is amazing."

    "You can see her eye following the bouncing ball on the screen, and her awkward mic technique looks like she got it from some rap film."

    #Don't the words light up instead of following a happy little ball?

    "The song ends in a flourish, and Lilly and I give her polite applause."

    "She smiles briefly, and sits back down on the couch."

    hi "That was… impressive."

    "Dammit, I didn't mean to pause there."

    "Hanako doesn't seem to have noticed, though."

    "She's obviously as excited as Lilly, who is flailing at the air, obviously searching for the mic."

    li "My turn, Hanako! My turn!"

    "And so the night progresses; Hanako and Lilly passing the mic between themselves and singing an amazing array of songs that I've never heard."

    "Each and every time I lay my hands on the remote or the mic, Hanako reefs it from me when it becomes apparent that I don't know what I'm doing with either."

    "I entertain myself by continuing to pour drinks for our little party."

    "Before long, the bottle is empty, and it's quite clearly taking effect."

    "Lilly's previously perfect pitch starts to drift, whilst Hanako now seems content to simply sing so loud that you could call it screaming."

    #lol bjork.
    #So you know, this is where changes start. ******

    "But there's one other effect that seems to be gripping the girls."

    ha "Um… Umm… 'scuseme!"

    "Hanako, only barely reaching the end of her song, throws the mic onto the couch and heads for the door."

    li "Fufufu, it seems that she may have to relieve herself…"

    "There are some things that I wish I didn't have to think about."

    li "However, this does give me a chance to have chat with you…"

    "Lilly slides along the couch until she is leaning against me."

    li "Tell me, Hisao…"

    "Her voice is hot against my cheek, and I resist the urge to simply wrap myself around her soft body."

    li "…do you like…"

    "My blood runs hot through me. Only now do I realise what a lethal combination alcohol and women makes."

    li "…Hanako?"

    "My warped reality bends back into shape, and not only due to the question."

    "It's the first time that Lilly has called Hanako by her name."

    "But, it does give me pause to think."

    "Just what has Hanako become to me?"

    "I know that I enjoy the hell out of spending time with the girls, but there's something about Hanako…"

    "It's like some uncontrollable urge to protect her, to shelter her from the slings and arrows of life…"

    "With the mic in hand, Lilly triggers the next song, and starts performing yet another song that I've never heard."

    "After only a single line, the door to our booth flies open, and a deranged Hanako stands in the doorway, furious."

    ha "Lilly! That's my song!"

    "I'm not sure if it's the dim lighting and the mild intoxication, but I could swear that Hanako is emitting a fierce aura right now."

    "Even Lilly looks a little shaken."

    "It's like Hanako has revealed her true form…"

    li "I… er… Here!"

    "Lilly throws the mic roughly in the direction of the door, which Hanako expertly catches."

    "It's the first time I've seen her move so fast, but I'm reminded of our time in the school Hall, where she had no problems swinging those huge speaker boxes around."

    "Could it be that I've underestimated her strength?"

    hi "It's alright, calm down… Here, let me re-start the song…"

    "Hanako glares at me, and then nods."

    ha "Thank you, Hisao. Lilly would have ruined this for you."

    li "Ah, Hanako… maybe… Ahm… excuse me…"

    "Lilly retreats through the open door, and closes it behind her."

    "Once again, the opening bars of this unknown song echo about the little room."

    "Hanako hoists the mic into her strange, upside-down position, and starts singing."

    "It's off key, but the timing seems to be spot on. I think."

    "Having never heard the song before, it's hard to tell."

    "But it's obvious that something has changed inside her. Like in the Hall, she seems totally different to her timid self."

    "Lilly's words ring around in my head."

    "Back then, Lilly said that Hanako only acted like this when she felt comfortable with her surroundings."

    "Does that mean that she's comfortable… with me?"

    "And, if that's the case, does that mean that Lilly's right? Does Hanako harbour some feelings for me?"

    "Watching her here, I can see that she is obviously happier when she is able to relax a little."

    "At school, she always seems to be so absorbed in her self that it's almost heartbreaking."

    "I wonder, then, if I can help her become more like this Hanako, all the time."

    "I guess… I want… well, to help her. To protect her. To spend time with her…"

    "Gargh! What am I thinking?"

    "I've never been so confused in my life."

    "The song comes to an abrupt flourish and an end, and Hanako beams at me."

    ha "So? How was it?"

    hi "I'm speechless. I never thought…"

    "I am cut off as the booth's door is flung open."

    hi "Lilly, no need to be…"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Miss Ikezawa, Young master, come quick!"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Miss Satou has had an accident!"

    "The smile on Hanako's face drops instantly, and she bolts for the door, jumping on the small table in the process."

    "I follow her as quickly as I can, but I don't have the agility to leap around as much as she does."

    "The store owner leads us to the small toilet cubicle, where Lilly is slowly picking herself up."

    ha "Lilly! Are you alright?! What's the matter?! Lilly!"

    "Lilly, who has now almost righted herself, laughs a little at Hanako's concern."

    li "Ah, Hanako, you needn't worry."

    li "I merely had a little fall, it's nothing at all… ouch!"

    "Lilly tries to stand without leaning on the wall, but winces as she puts weight on her right foot."

    ha "Lilly? Is something the matter?"

    li "Ah, nothing at all… although I think I may have hurt my ankle a little…"

    "Upon hearing this, Hanako slings Lilly's arm over her shoulders, and acts as a crutch for her."

    ha "Hisao, can you please get her cane and call a cab?"

    ha "We have to get Lilly back to bed."

    hi "S…sure thing."

    "I gather up Lilly's cane, and start making for the exit."

    "Behind me, the two girls limp down the hallway."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Are you sure this is alright?"

    li "Yes, it's only a little bruise. It'll clear up in no time."

    li "Please, don't worry yourself."

    li "I think Hanako here is simply over-reacting."

    ha "Lilly, you need to value yourself more. Tomorrow we'll have the nurse check you out."

    "All of the commotion has drawn a small crowd out from the other booths."

    "However, since she has been fretting over Lilly, Hanako takes a moment to notice."

    "Stranger" "Say, do you girls need some help?"

    "Stranger 2" "Is everything alright?"

    "Hanako's confidence drains from her the instant she notices the crowd building around her."

    "In the small confines of the hallway, they are practically touching her."

    "She seems to forget about Lilly, and starts hiding her face from the on-lookers."

    "I dash back from the exit, just in time to catch Hanako as she drops to her knees."

    "Lilly, now without Hanako's support, frantically reaches out to stop herself from falling."

    "She manages to grab my ear, which she uses as a guide to find my shoulder."

    "I try to help Hanako up, but she feels like she is made of lead."

    "With Lilly pressing down on me, and Hanako leaning into me, I can't move."

    hi "Guys, this isn't a freak show. Can you just leave us alone?"

    "The onlookers jump at my sudden shouting."

    "Yet no-one moves."

    hi "I said…"

    "Karaoke Woman" "Come on you lot, move it along. Leave these guys be."

    "The Store owner steps in and saves the day."

    "Her commanding voice spurs on the crowd, who disappear back into their respective booths."

    "Karaoke Woman" "There's a cab waiting outside. You'd best be off."

    "Karaoke Woman" "Here, Miss Satou, I'll give you a hand…"

    "With that, the store owner relieves me of my duties towards Lilly, allowing me to focus on the rag-doll Hanako."

    hi "Hey, come on, let's go."

    ha "Why?"

    hi "Eh? Why? Because Lilly is hurt, right?"

    ha "No. Why? Why does it always end like this?"

    hi "I'm… not sure I follow you…"

    "I can see Hanako straining to fight back tears."

    "For reasons beyond my knowledge, I pull her face into my chest, as if to hide her from the world."

    "Instantly, she wraps her arms around my torso, pulling her body into mine."

    "Through my bones, I can feel her sobbing gently."

    hi "Come on, let's go. You can stay like that, but let's get out of here."

    "I feel her rub her face against my chest, the equivalent of a nod."

    "We combine our strength, and walk to the door, Hanako still wrapped around me."

    "Lilly is already in the front seat of the cab, her cane held gently in her hand."

    "She nods at our approach, and motions towards the back seat."

    "Hanako crawls into the open door first and I behind her."

    "The door shuts, and the cab pulls away from the curb."

    "As if avoiding the occasional glances in the rear-view mirror, Hanako hides her face in my shoulder."

    "The trip passes in silence, and Lilly picks up the fare."

    hi "Hanako, I have to help Lilly out now… will you be alright?"

    "Hanako looks me in the eyes for the first time since the booth."

    ha "Y…I'll be fine."

    "I get out of the cab and open Lilly's door for her, helping her out gently, as to not put any weight on her sore ankle."

    li "My my, thank you Hisao. You are a gentleman."

    hi "Not at all. I can't let you walk back like that, especially on your birthday…"

    li "Oh! I nearly forgot about that in all the excitement!"

    "Who the hell forgets their birthday, especially their 18th?"

    hi "I'm amazed. Still, we should be off. Hanako?"

    "I turn to find Hanako, head down, and holding onto the back of my shirt."

    "I feel like some strange pack mule, carrying one passenger and hauling another."

    "But I can understand. I don't think Hanako really wants to be alone right now, but she knows that Lilly is hurt."

    "Even someone as dull as I can see the conflict written on her half-hidden face."

    "We make the walk across the school in silence. At this hour, there's barely a soul to be seen."

    "The darkness is pierced by the lampposts spread around the school, the shadows they cast angular and overlapping."

    "Even at the dorms, only a handful of the room lights are still lit up."

    "I am thankful for Lilly's ground-floor room, as I'm not sure how our strange procession would handle stairs."

    "Lilly, as soon as she is in her room, sits on her bed."

    li "Hisao, Hanako, thank you for a marvellous evening, even if I did spoil it."

    li "However, I think I might beg your forgiveness, and ask you to both leave."

    li "My ankle isn't that bad, it should be fine with a bit of rest. But if you two were to stay I'd never get to sleep…"

    hi "Is there anything that we can get you? I feel bad about just dumping you here…"

    li "No, I will be perfectly fine. The more sleep I get, the quicker this will heal."

    li "Besides, I do like you Hisao, however I am not yet comfortable in letting you watch me change… yet."

    "Lilly smiles mischievously at me, and I get the point."

    hi "Ah, I… right. Well, sleep well. Call me should you have any problems."

    li "Thank you for your support, Hisao."

    li "And you too, Hanako, for coming to my rescue."

    ha "…elcome."

    "Hanako's voice barely even registers as exhalation, but the sentiment is still there."

    "We both leave Lilly's room, and close the door behind us."

    "Hanako still clings to the back of my shirt. It doesn't look like I'm going to shake her that easily."

    hi "Shall we go back to your room?"

    "I feel a slight tug on my shirt. I guess that could mean anything, so I just head for Hanako's room anyway."

    "Since there's no further resistance on my clothing, I assume this was the right choice."

    "Once again, we enter Hanako's sparely decorated room."

    "I sit down on her bed, followed by Hanako."

    "The shift in position makes me feel the moisture in the chest and shoulder of my shirt."

    "Hanako's face still looks more despondent than I've ever seen."

    "Her normally perfect hair is in tatters, and her dress looks like she's slept in it."

    "The bangs that usually cover the scarred side of her face are matted, revealing the darker skin of the grafts, and her right eye."

    "I know it's wrong for me to look, but I can't help myself."

    "She hides this part of her life away from the world, so I feel slightly special to be able to have it revealed to me."

    "I can't believe that about an hour ago she was singing happily with her friends."

    hi "Hey… what's up?"

    ha "I couldn't help."

    hi "Sorry?"

    ha "Lilly was hurt, but I couldn't help."

    ha "It's always like that… I think I can help, but then… I just… can't…"

    "Tears well up in her eyes again."

    "I can't take it anymore."

    "I reach out, and throw my arms around her shoulders."

    hi "You did help. You got to Lilly ages before I did. You helped her up."

    hi "And you help me too. I'd be lost here without you."

    hi "So stop talking nonsense. Neither Lilly nor I would be able to get by without you."

    ha "Y… do you mean that?"

    "I squeeze her towards me."

    hi "Of course I mean it!"

    hi "I don't ever want to see you like this again, ever!"

    #yes, double ever for effect.

    "Slowly, deliberately, Hanako returns my embrace."

    "Lilly's words from the Karaoke booth resound in my mind."

    #have we got a flashback effect?

    li "…she likes you…"

    "I'm not sure if I like Hanako or not, but I do know one thing."

    "I'd much rather see her singing off key than crying."

    "A million thoughts run through my mind."

    "What does Hanako mean to me?"

    hi "Hanako…"

    "Why do I feel pain when she cries, or when she gest taunted?"

    hi "…I want you to know…"

    "Why does she feel so comfortable with me when she can barely stand to be in class?"

    hi "…that I like you…"

    "Who else makes me feel like this?"

    hi "No, that's not it."

    "Who else?"

    hi "Hanako… I want you to go out with me."

    #it would be good if there were some kind of stoppage here. Like music and art. I dunno.

    "We sit there, in each other's arms on Hanako's bed for what seems like an eternity."

    "I'm not entirely sure why I'm saying such a ridiculous thing, but it feels right."

    "And I'm not sure what Hanako thinks either. It's impossible to read her at the best of times, and not she's just sitting here, immobile, silent."

    ha "…"

    hi "Um, I'm sorry?"

    ha "okay"

    #I want to keep that without punctuation or caps.

    "A whisper escapes from her lips. If we were any further apart than we are right now, then I would have never heard it."

    "A special word, meant only for my ears."

    "Slowly, methodically, Hanako removes herself from my embrace."

    "I feel the familiar, warm wetness against my shoulder. Hanako has been crying."

    #there, you fucks, you got your tears. Happy now?

    "Her eyes, still bloodshot and glossy with tears, show a strange sense of satisfaction."

    ha "Thank you"

    "Now it is I who is speechless."

    "Despite the tears, the ragged hair and the crumpled dress, Hanako is still a beautiful girl."

    "One that I will now devote myself to."

    "I'm not sure why or how we have brought ourselves to this point, but, now that we have, I don't think I ever want to go back."

    ha "Um, Hisao…"

    hi "Yes?"

    "I jump in surprise, only now realising that I've been staring at the shiest girl in the school."

    "Good work there, jackarse."

    ha "I… I know that you just said that, but…"

    "Wait what? Am I about to taste the bitter sting of rejection?"

    "My heart sinks six feet, and I start to feel short of breath."

    hi "But?"

    "Hanako starts to clam up, and avert her gaze."

    "Here is comes…"

    ha "Um, well I, um…"

    ha "I don't think you should see me getting changed yet…"

    hi "Eh?"

    ha "Well, we just started going out, but… um… but you shouldn't see me yet."

    "Realisation sets in."

    hi "Oh! Sorry! I didn't mean to… ah crap…"

    "Hanako, who is now totally avoiding my gaze, starts to blush."

    hi "Illseeyoutomorrow!"

    "As I rush past Hanako on the way out, I notice that she is smiling, ever so slightly."

    "What the hell have I just gotten myself into?"
