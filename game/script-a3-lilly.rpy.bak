    hi "Well, there goes school. It's already nine thirty, and you two're in no shape to go to class."

    li "Mm, you have a point. I guess I did drink a little too much."

    "Thinking back, she drank almost the entire wine bottle by herself."

    "Compared to Hanako and I, she has quite the alcohol tolerance."

    "Yuuko though… Half the vodka, a quarter of the rum, and about a quarter of the wine as well."

    "It's no wonder she ended up completely drunk and singing alongside the rather carefree Hanako."

    "It'd have been quite the sight if Lilly and I hadn't needed to continually quieten the two down lest others hear the drunken racket."

    "I turn up to look at her, my face distinctly flat."

    hi "She doesn't seem that confident."

    "She shakes her head vigorously"

    li "Before you came, it wouldn't be unusual for her to skip class out of fright, or recoil away from anyone who even glanced at her."

    hi "Uh… huh."

    "Thinking back to the meeting at the cafe and our trip through town, she does seem less skittish around others."

    "Though around me she still struggles to say so much as an unbroken sentence."

    "I guess shyness is just a part of her personality."

    "Even as I grimace though, Lilly gives a deep, warm smile."

    li "Thank you, Hisao. She may seem somewhat shy at times, but you've helped her so much."

    hi "Ah… t—thanks."

    "I look away from her kind face, suddenly feeling more than a touch embarassed."

    hi "How're you feeling today?"

    ha "Did it hurt?"

    li "Well, I'd be lying if I said it didn't."

    "The statement causes Hanako to lower her head in silence."

    li "Ah, it didn't hurt that much though. After a few hours, there wasn't much pain."

    "Hanako lifts her head slightly, but still looks downtrodden."

    "It's all too obvious obvious Lilly's downplaying it, and covering up her accidentally honest reply."

    hi "Heard from Hanako about what's been going on in the school so far?"

    li "Mm, she's given me quite a good report."

    "As another of Muto's droning lectures comes to a close, the class sighs in relief."

    "Lunchtime."

    "A symbol of freedom and liberty for every highschool student across the nation."

    "I grab my bag from the side of the desk and swing it up to shove the lesson's sheets inside."

    "As I look at the top sheet before putting it in, the forboding text at the top beckons."

    $ written_note("EXAM REVISION SHEET 3:\nTHE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS")

    "In contrast to Muto's scruffy and barely-legible handwriting, it's clearly printed from a word processor."

    "That alone's enough to see it's mandatory revision work, as opposed to his usual teaching material."

    "The sheet's text also lacks his penchant for extremely spartan sentence structures."

    "He's a scientist, alright."

    "But then again, I have to wonder why the hell he's a teacher and not a researcher."

    "It's pretty obvious he's not exactly the best for the job."

    "Well, such are the mysteries of life I suppose."

    "As I slot in one sheet after another, I pause as I suddenly hear my name from the other side of the room."

    "Looking over to the door, I see two girls talking, with one pointing directly at me."

    "The one pointing's a girl from our class—a tomboyish and athletic black-haired girl called Miki who accidentally lost her hand thanks to her father's powertools."

    "I shudder slightly."

    "That's one conversation I wish I hadn't overheard."

    "The other, though, I've never seen before."

    "She looks small with dark brown twin braided hair, and seems quite pretty."

    "From the fact that she doesn't look to have anything wrong with her, and was talking to Miki, she must either be an interpreter or blind."

    "I leave my bag on the desk and walk over to the two at the door."

    "Miki" "Ah, here he is."

    hi "You want me?"

    "Girl 2" "Are you… uh…"

    "Miki" "Hisao. The guy you want's called Hisao."

    hi "Yeah, that's me."

    "Girl 2" "Um, would you be able to give this to Li— I mean, Satou, for class 3-3?"

    "She holds up a small stuffed teddy bear."

    "Judging by the fact that her face hardly moves at all as I take it, I guess she must be blind."

    "I hold it in my hands and quickly examine it."

    "Soft and fluffy, the stiff joints make it seem closer to a collector's item than a plaything."

    "Though, considering what Lilly's personality is like, it seems like the perfect present."

    "Miki" "Dammit, looks like I owe you five then."

    "I look up from the bear to her."

    "Girl 2" "You never saw it?"

    "Yep, she's blind. Even as she talks to Miki, her head doesn't move."

    "Seeing her act like this reminds me of just how much practice Lilly must put into making her mannerisms appear normal."

    "Miki" "Hey, don't blame me for not being a social butterfly. The track club's not a social party, you know."

    hi "Um, what's going on?"

    "Miki" "Huh?"

    "She suddenly looks over, seemingly forgetting the fact that I could hear her."

    "Miki" "Oh yeah, me and Aoi had a little bet."

    "She looks sharply at the other girl, putting her only hand on her hip."

    "Miki" "Which I lost."

    "Aoi's face becomes pained."

    "Aoi" "I never said you had to pay up right now."

    hi "I'm still lost here."

    "Aoi" "Ah ha… We kind of made a bet about whether you and Lilly were dating."

    hi "You've got to be kidding me."

    "Miki" "Quite the Casanova, aren't ya?"

    hi "Hey, don't get the wrong idea here. I'm not going out with her."

    "Aoi" "Whaaaat?"

    "Miki" "Ha ha! Looks like I'm rich!"

    "She proudly puffs out her chest as the other pouts. It doesn't take a genius to see who bet either way."

    hi "Fine, I'll take the card to her."

    "Aoi" "Um, thanks… Hisao."

    "With that, the two leave the room. Even from inside I can hear the laughter and protesting between them."

    "As I grab my bag and carefully slip the card inside, an unwelcome voice rings out from behind me."

    mi "Hicchan~"

    hi "Uh-oh. Uh, I mean, hey Misha, Shizune."

    "As I turn around to meet them, I give a small wave to Shizune with my free hand."

    mi "We heard what happened, Hicchan."

    hi "I'd be surprised if the student council hadn't, practically the entire school has by now."

    "She looks up in thought, bringing her finger to her chin to exaggerate the point."

    mi "You do have a point…"

    "Shizune reaches forward and taps her on the shoulder twice to grab her attention."

    mi "What is it, Shicchan?"

    "Shizune starts to sign, but once she's finished Misha starts to sign back. Interpretation isn't meant to work this way, I'm sure of it."

    "The two seem to have a comfortable chat as I stand patiently waiting. Though, that's only a guess at what they're saying."

    "For all I know, they could be planning the radical feminist movement's next—" #reminder for the potential {nw} break

    "NO! NO! NOT THAT! DAMMIT, KENJI! GET OUT OF MY MIND!"

    "As I rough my hair in frustration, Misha pauses and looks over."

    "I guess she misinterpreted it as frustration at her."

    mi "Shicchan says,"

    "She brings her hand to her mouth and clears her throat in the most formal manner she can summon."

    mi "The student council wishes to extend their best wishes for Lilly Satou's quick recovery, and are prepared to help you as far as our duties allow."

    "Once she's finished, she looks sideways to Shizune."

    "An affirmative nod. I guess their talk was a negotiation about the wording of their, for lack of a better term, press release."

    hi "Thanks you two. It's good to know I can depend on you."

    mi "How could we call ourselves the student council if we couldn't support the students, Hicchan?"

    hi "Yeah, you've got a point. Still, thanks. Both of you."

    mi "No problem. Shicchan and I had better be off, though."

    mi "See you later, Hicchan!"

    hi "Seeya."

    "With that, they move to Shizune's desk to fish out some books."

    "What to do, what to do…"

    "I'm not exactly overly hungry, and a quick glance at Hanako's desk is all that's needed to see that she's left."

    "Boy" "OUT OF THE WAY! OUT OF THE WAY!"

    hi "Huh?"

    "As I look back, the scene plays out as if it were a sequence of still frames."

    "A boy in a wheelchair is moving, nay, careering, along the hall."

    "I see that, unfortunately, I seem to be the only one who hasn't moved out of his way."

    "His face changes from one of determination to one of panic."

    "He opens his mouth to yell, but it's too late."

    "He slams into me at full speed, sending me flying sideways and his wheelchair swinging around to a sliding halt."

    hi "Shit. Shit. Shit."

    "I open my eyes as I prop myself up with my arms."

    "Boy" "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

    "Girl" "Are you alright?"

    "I look up and back to the classroom I'd exited not long ago."

    "Misha stands there, a worried look on her face."

    "I move my hand up and wave away her concern with a grin."

    hi "I'm fine, no harm done."

    "As I say it, I notice a movement out of the corner of my eye."

    "Following it, I see Shizune striding up to the wheeled bandit."

    "All I can do is grimace in anticipation of what's to come."

    "He looks from me to her, and instantly looks stricken with fear."

    "Looks like she has a reputation."

    "She steps up to him confidently and puts her hands on her hips."

    "Seconds pass."

    "Boy" "Uh… Um… I—I… didn't mean to…"

    "Without warning, she steps behind his wheelchair and latches onto the handles with an iron grip."

    "And just like that, she starts to wheel him away."

    "Boy" "H—Hey! What're you doing!? Hey, hold on!"

    "All I can do is look on with a bemused expression."

    hi "He's screwed, isn't he?"

    "Misha grins wildly. Don't tell me she secretly enjoys Shizune doing this…"

    hi "Go easy on him, will ya?"

    mi "Hmm, I'm not sure I can do that, Hicchan. Once Shicchan sets her mind on something, she's very stubborn."

    "While I don't doubt her claim one bit, I can't help but notice a distinct lack of regret about it."

    mi "Need a hand?"

    "I suddenly realise I'm still on the floor, propping myself up with an arm."

    hi "Yeah, thanks."

    "She reaches out a hand, which I clasp in mine and lever myself up with."

    "She has a surprisingly strong grip, given her looks."

    hi "Thanks."

    mi "No problem~"

    "And with that, she merrily walks off down the hall after Shizune."

    "Considering it's placement at the very back corner of the library, I'm surprised I even managed to catch sight of her."

    "As I casually stroll up, I see her reading a book placed flat on the surface, her left hand both hiding her face and holding her hair back."
