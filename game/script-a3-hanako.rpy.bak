    "My alarm chimes, letting me know that my sleepless night is at an end."

    "Last night's events are still running rampant through my head… most importantly, I can't get Hanako's face out of my mind…"

    "Nor how she felt in my arms…"

    "…she felt good. Really good."

    "I shake the bad thoughts from my mind, and go about my morning ritual."
    
    "Pants… pills… shirt… shoes…"

    "If there's one thing I can say about not sleeping, it's that you tend to be a lot faster in getting ready."

    "It's almost a good hour before classes; I guess I can even manage to have a decent breakfast."

    "But… not alone. The Great Hall would have only opened for breakfast about ten minutes ago, so if I hurry…"

    "I grab my books and bolt down out of the dorm."

    "Outside, it seems like I've just caught the school in the process of waking up."

    "The footpaths are practically empty. I can only see five juniors heading towards the hall."

    "Realising that I'm probably too early for my quarry, I take up position by the door to the girls' dorm, and wait."

    "Soon, the door creaks open, and I snap to attention."

    "Two girls issue forth from the portal, busily signing to each other, make their way towards the hall."

    "They're so engrossed in their conversation that they don't even notice me loitering by the doorway."

    "I guess that's lucky. I think I'd have a hard time explaining why I'm waiting out the front of the dorm, looking like I hadn't slept all night and jumping at every thing."

    "Time ticks on by, and more girls start leaving the dorm in various states of dress and purpose."

    "With each new arrival, I feel more and more like some kind of deranged stalker."

    "Maybe I should just…"

    "The door opens one more time, and I look away in a vain attempt to make it look like I'm not checking out every girl as they leave…"

    ha "Hisao?"

    "I have the worst timing ever."

    hi "Hey! Hanako! What are you doing here?"

    "Hanako looks like she's had about as much sleep as I did."

    "I can even see that her hair is slightly damp… I guess she spent some time in the bath…"

    ha "Um, I… live here…"

    hi "Oh, yeah… Haha… you wanna grab some breakfast?"

    ha "Yes… let's go."

    hi "How's Lilly, by the way?"

    ha "She said she's taking the day off to rest her ankle…"

    hi "Ankle? Oh… right…"

    "My tired brain is taking its sweet time in remembering things."

    "For a second there, I almost forgot the catalyst to last night's events."

    hi "I almost forgot… I didn't get much sleep last night…"

    "Hanako looks up at me, surprised."

    ha "You too?"

    hi "Heh, well… a lot of stuff happened."

    hi "I don't think I've ever said stuff like that before…"

    #hanako despondent

    ha "Oh… I see…"

    hi "No! That's not what I mean! I meant everything I said, I just…"

    hi "…wish I was a little more eloquent."

    "Hanako shakes her head softly."

    ha "No… it was perfect."

    "I can't argue with her. It was a strange night, but I don't regret a thing."

    "In this morning glow, and with the haze of a sleepless night, Hanako looks amazing."

    "Her head slightly bowed, her faint smile creeping from the corners of her lips, both hands gently clasped around her bag's handles…"

    "I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it through the day without my tired thoughts drifting in the direction of this vision."

    #BG change to the hall

    "The hall is only barely populated at this hour. Rows of tables are empty, with only a handful of students breaking the monotony."

    "The trip through the {a=LolReplace}serving line{/a} is fantastically fast; I should maybe get up a little earlier in future."

    "We start our meals in silence, the combination of feeding and fatigue precluding any conversation."

    "Strangely enough, it is Hanako that speaks first."

    ha "Say…"

    hi "Mm?"

    ha "Should we… tell people?"

    hi "You mean, about us?"

    ha "Yeah."

    "I contemplate the question whilst finishing off my toast."

    "Sure, it'd be great to brag about having a girlfriend and all, but I'm not sure how Hanako would take that."

    "Plus, I haven't really heard much about other couple at the school."

    "Maybe gossip isn't really that popular here."

    "And Hanako's not really the big-mouthed type anyway. It's probably best not to draw any unwanted attention to ourselves."

    hi "I don't think there's any need to."

    hi "I mean, we both know that we're going out, right?"

    hi "It's not like anyone else is involved in that process, are they?"

    "Hanako contemplates this for a moment."

    ha "You're right."

    "Silence once again befalls us as we finish our meals."

    "Around us, the Hall rapidly fills up, with people looking more and more determined and rushed with every passing second."

    ha "We should go… I have to tell Lilly's teachers too…"

    hi "Okay. I'll come with you."

    "We clear our plates, and then move to the Staff Room in the main building."

    "Hanako quickly and quietly explains Lilly's situation to her homeroom teacher, and then backs out of the room."

    "As if queued by Hanako closing the door, the warning bells sound for the beginning of school"

    hi "We'd best get going."

    ha "Right."

    "We climb the stairs to the third floor, and slide back the classroom's door."

    "Looks like we're the last ones here this morning."

    "A familiar laugh is audible above the subdued chatter of the other students."

    mi "Whahaha, the lovers finally get here at last!"

    #hanako shocked.

    "Hanako and I reel back in surprise."

    hi "Wai…what? How did you hear?"

    "The class falls silent, including Misha."

    "Her expression hasn't changed, but it's just… frozen."

    "As if she's just heard some life-changing news."

    "Even her finger is still outstretched, singling us out."

    mi "eh?"

    "She quickly looks to Shizune, as if trying to read an answer from her face."

    "Finding nothing there, she looks back at us."

    "This process repeats about five times, with the rest of the class trying to determine what is going on."

    "Shizune signs something repeatedly to Misha, but gets no response."

    "Finally, she stands up, frustrated, and applies a healthy dose of karate-chop to the top of Misha's skull."

    "I can feel the impact from here…"

    "Misha snaps to, and the pair exchange a flurry of sign."

    "Shizune, obviously agitated at the news, storms towards us, and takes up position about an inch away from my face."

    "In the limited space between us, she tries signing something to me."

    hi "Um, I have no idea what…"

    mi "Is this true? Are you two really… really…"

    "Huh, so there's even ellipsis in sign…"

    hi "Well, yes. Yes we are."

    "I give her an exaggerated nod, just in case."

    "She turns up her nose, and returns to her seat, facing away from me, nose upturned."

    hi "Is that sign language for “I'm pissed off,” Misha?"

    mi "Um, what? No, that's this…"

    "Misha shows me some convoluted sign."

    "I guess she's still too confused to process my lame attempts at humour."

    "Slowly, people start to turn back to each other and re-start the conversations that they were having before we interrupted them."

    "I gently grab the shaken Hanako's hand and lead her to her seat."

    "Before heading back to my seat, I whisper in her ear."

    hi "Never mind them. Like I said before, we're the only ones that matter, right?"

    ha "…right."

    "As I sit down, Misha squeezes past the immobile Shizune to talk to me."

    "Thankfully, she uses her quiet voice this time."

    "Even still, I'm sure they can hear her in the next town."

    mi "So, are you two really… lovers?"

    hi "Well, we're going out, so… yes."

    #Misha recoiling

    mi "So you have done it?!"

    hi "What? No! Where did you get that idea?"

    "Misha's eyes dart from me to Shizune and back again."

    "Wait… did she just…"

    mi "So you really haven't done it? You're just going out, right?"

    hi "Yes, why would you think anything different."

    "Misha laughs, but this time, it's a nervous version of her usual guffaw."

    mi "Um… Can I get you to wait a second please? I just have to… tell Shizune something."

    "Misha slinks back into Shizune's field of vision, and sheepishly signs something to her."

    "There is a slight pause without any reaction from Shizune, and then Misha tries again."

    "Still Shizune doesn't react… wait…"

    "If you look closely, you'll notice that Sizune is starting to shake… and it's becoming more pronounced as the apologetic Misha keeps on signing."

    "Suddenly she springs out of her seat, as if bitten by something, and once again karate-chops Misha's head."

    "As Misha rubs her head, Shizune gives her a short lecture in sign, ending with her pointing at me."

    "Misha nods sheepishly, and carefully makes her way around the upright Shizune."

    mi "Um, Hisao?"

    hi "Yes Misha?"

    mi "Um, Shizune wants me to apologise to you for the misunderstanding you caused… I mean I caused…"

    hi "That's okay, it looks like you were the one that bore the brunt of it, anyway."

    mi "But it's true, right? You and Hanako?"

    mi "I've seen you leaving our dorm pretty late some nights. You could come and visit me, you know…"

    "Misha gives me what I think she thinks a sultry wink, but since she's nursing her head and fighting back tears of pain, it looks more like she's suffering from some kind of mental disorder."

    "What am I talking about? It's quite clear that Misha is a mental case…"

    "Before I have a chance to answer her, Muto barges into the classroom, babbling something incoherent about the momentum of traffic flow, and everyone quickly pretends that they are paying attention."

    "I turn to Hanako, and give her a little wave of encouragement."

    "This seems to perk her up a little, and she returns the favour."

    "I feel my heart jump, and thank the fact that I remembered my meds this morning."

    "I really need to sleep more."

    "Muto's droning continues and, as expected, my mind drifts to visions of Hanako…"

    "I see her as she was this morning, and how she was last night, and how she was on the yacht…"

    "Soon, I realise that I'm drifting off to sleep."

    "I'm not sure if I realised that on my own, or if the sharp pain in my head alerted me to this fact."

    "My visions fade instantly, and before my eyes I see a notebook."

    $ written_note(u"Fall asleep again and I won't go so easy on you.\nIt'll make the taps I gave Misha this morning look like a pat on the back…\n\n—S")

    "The throbbing in my skull is now explained."

    "I turn to see an angry Shizune, arm outstretched."

    "As I look at her sleepily, she begins to roll up her sleeve."

    hi "I'm up! I'm up! Wait… damnit…"

    "I hurriedly grab a pencil and scribble “I'm up!” over Shizune's note…"

    "…but it's no good."

    "As I nurse the new lump on my head, Shizune once again slides her notebook under my face."

    "The usual crowds are gathered throughout the school grounds."

    "Students chatting, sitting on the grass and eating their meals."

    "Some of the more eager have already finished, and are closely approximating “running around like idiots.”"

    "I can't even tell what game they're trying to play, but it seems to involve some kind of wooden… thing…"

    "Girl 1"  "It's true! I heard it from one of the girls who knows someone in his class!"

    ha "Eh? I… I didn't mean it… I want to be here… I want… I… um…"

    "My scoffing turns to total laugher."

    hi "That's not what I mean… I was doing the exact same thing as you…"

    hi "Let's just relax and tackle today as it comes, okay?"

    #hanako recovers

    ha "…kay."

    "I must say, I feel a lot more relaxed now."

    "Hanako is surely in the same state that I am; she doesn't seem like the type that's been on a lot of dates."

    "Actually, she's not really fond of going into the city either, so it's probably doubly hard for her."

    "Crap. I almost forgot about her and crowds…"

    hi "Say… when we get into the city… would you like to, er, walk with me?"

    ha "W—what do you mean?"

    hi "Well, if you'd like, I think it would be nice if we walked together… like when we went, er, clothes shopping…"

    #hanako slight smile

    ha "I think I would like that, Hisao."

    "Behind my back, I punch the air a little in celebration."

    "I'm not sure why, but I feel as if I have won a great victory…"

    "…even if Hanako and I have walked arm-in-arm a few times before."

    "The bus disposes of us in front of the station, and departs without ceremony."

    hi "Well, shall we?"

    "I hold out my left arm for Hanako, who accepts it gratefully."

    "I can feel her pulling her scarred side into my body, hiding it from the world."

    "I know that this isn't the first time we've done this, but something feels… slightly different."

    ha "Yes, let's go."

    "We set off as one unit to the address scrawled on the back of the tickets."

    "Surprisingly, it's not far from the station, only two block's walk."

    hi "I guess this is it… 5th floor…"

    ha "It's a little different to what Lilly was saying…"

    "I can't help but agree with Hanako."

    "Whilst it's not exactly run-down, the seven-story building in front of us doesn't exactly look like a place Lilly would frequent."

    "Then again, she does seem to know a lot of strange places around town, so it really shouldn't surprise us."

    hi "Well, it was Lilly that gave us the tickets."

    hi "I'm sure she wouldn't send us anywhere… too strange…"

    "Hanako gives me a sceptical look."

    hi "…right?"

    "Doubt creeps over Hanako's face, and I daresay that I would look fairly similar."

    ha "Maybe we should just…"

    hi "No, let's do this. Besides, Lilly might ask us about it, and you know she can tell when we're lying."

    #Hanako paniced

    ha "You're right, I can never seem to be able to lie to her."

    "I gulp down some courage, and squeeze Hanako's arm slightly."

    hi "Let's go."

    "We push through the main doors and make our way up the narrow staircase."

    "The building seems to contain all sorts of odd stores."

    "We pass a hobby shop and some kind of bar/restaurant on the way up to the fifth floor."

    "The door to Central Music Café looks fairly plain, too."

    "It's just a wooden door with an old vinyl record stuck to it."

    "The label on the record simple reads “Central Music.”"

    hi "Well, here goes nothing…"

    "I push open the door, and am greeted by a short waitress wearing fairly typical street clothes."

    "She takes the tickets from me, and shows Hanako and I to our seats."

    "I start to see why Lilly chose this place."

    "The entire place is set out like a 50's American diner; the seating is split up into four-person booths."

    "The booths are separated by panes of frosted glass above the already high-backed chairs, totally isolating each booth from the next."

    "Vinyl records and CDs adorn the walls, as well as the occasional autographed photo of musicians."

    "In the centre of each table is a small screen, similar to a karaoke selection panel, as well as four headphone jacks."

    "As Hanako and I sit next to each other in our booth, the waitress brings over a menu and two sets of headphones."

    #waitress doesn't need sprites.

    "Waitress" "Your tickets will last for two hours, and include unlimited food and drinks."

    "Waitress" "If you have any problems with your control panel, please just call me."

    "Waitress" "Enjoy your stay."

    "She bows slightly to us and then returns to her post at the counter."

    hi "So, what do you… eh?"

    "As I turn to Hanako, I find that she's already got her headphones on and is attacking the control panel with the vigour of a madman."

    hi "Um, Hanako…?"

    #Hanako grinning

    "Hanako finishes her selections, then turns at me, beaming."

    ha "This is great! They've got everything here… listen!"

    "Before I can say a word, Hanako slams the headphones onto my head."

    "My world fills with the strange sounds of Hanako's favourite music; some indescribable foreign song."

    "It's not entirely unlikeable, either. There's something about the strange beat and energetic singing that leave me tapping my fingers on the table."

    hi "Oh… so this is just a media café, right?"

    "My words fall upon deaf ears. Hanako is lost in her headphones."

    "Realising I won't get anything out of her until the song ends, I summon the waitress and order some iced coffees."

    "I replace my headphones and wait for the song to end."

    "Hanako slowly opens her eyes and awakens from her reverie."

    ha "S…sorry. I just really like that song."

    hi "I've heard it before… what's it called."

    ha "Bad Apple. I just can't hear it enough of it."

    hi "I see. Anyway, since you were kinda lost for a bit there, I ordered us some drinks."

    ha "Oh, thank you. Do you want to choose some songs?"

    "I consider it for a second, but it honestly looks like Hanako is having fun here."

    "In the privacy of the booth and with a set of headphones on, she seems to have become totally relaxed."

    hi "No, it's fine. I trust your selection anyway."

    ha "Oh… really? Lilly doesn't seem to like it much…"

    hi "Well, I'm not Lilly. Plus, it's good to try new things, right?"

    #Hanako thinking

    ha "I suppose you're right."

    "Hanako hits a button on the control panel, triggering the next song."

    "Again I am engulfed in a world of music, different from the last track but still totally alien to anything else I've heard before."

    "Before long, I find myself following Hanako's lead and just losing myself in the sounds."

    "Seeing my enthusiasm, Hanako starts explaining the origin of each track, using incomprehensible terms like “compression” and “dynamic range.”"

    "Before long, we are deep in conversation about the benefits and shortfalls of modern music."

    "All of the nervousness that we both felt on the bus has completely vanished."

    "Wait, it's more than that. For what feels like the first time ever, we're having a free-flowing conversation."

    "After the last few days, fighting off the stares and comments from classmates, I guess we're both just relieved to be alone."

    "What's more, the ordeal of Misha's overreaction seems to have drawn us closer together."

    "Our conversations become so engrossing that the waitress has to tap me on the shoulder to let us know our time is up."

    "Grudgingly, we return our headphones and start the descent back to street level."

    hi "I can't believe that two hours is up already. We didn't even eat anything…"

    ha "Mmm. I am a bit hungry, but…"

    "As we near the ground level, I see Hanako's confidence slowly dissolving."

    "No matter how she acts when she's alone, she's always going to be daunted by crowds."

    "And the noise from the street is already starting to waft up the stairwell."

    "I grab a hold of Hanako, and pull her into my side once more."

    hi "Don't worry, we'll find someplace quiet."

    ha "T—thanks…"

    "We make our grand entrance onto the street as a single unit."

    "The streets of the town are busier than they were when we arrived; both sides of the street are an unending procession of pedestrians."

    hi "Are you going to be alright?"

    "Hanako squeezes my arm ever so slightly."

    ha "I think I'll be fine."

    "I take a deep breath, and set out into the human river on the footpath."

label en_H18:

    "Looking for a way to quench our hunger, I spy a convenience store across the road."

    hi "How's about we grab something from there?"

    ha "Okay."

    "We cross the street and enter the store, jogging slightly to dodge the traffic."

    "Inside, the single shop attendant acknowledges us with a slight nod then returns to reading his paper."

    "I grab some random foodstuffs and a couple of drinks from the fridge, pay the attendant, and head back out onto the street."

    "Hanako once again takes up position close to my side, nuzzling into me."

    "Somehow, this is different from our previous forays into town."

    "Hanako feels like she wants to get closer to me, not just hide from the world."

    "And I want to be closer to her… almost unbearably so…"

    "Nervously, I reach around her shoulders and pull her into my side."

    #Hana Shock

    ha "Eh?"

    "I quickly retrieve my arm."

    hi "Sorry, I didn't mean…um"

    #Blushy-blush

    ha "It's alright…."

    ha "G… go ahead…"

    "As she replies, Hanako reaches around my waist with her right arm, pulling herself even closer to my body."

    "Her sudden warmth and a rush of blood raise my body temperature to fever levels."

    "For a second, albeit shakier, time, I reach across Hanako's narrow shoulders."

    "Again she jumps a little at my touch, but she gently squeezes my waist as assign to continue."

    "With each other firmly in our embrace, we continue along the roadside."

    ha "T…this is the first time I've done this…"

    hi "Me too…"

    "Both of us seem far too embarrassed to hold any worthwhile conversation."

    "Oddly, that feels right."

    "Before long, we find ourselves in the town's central park."

    "I've never been here before, but Hanako leads us up a slight hill into a secluded area."

    "Towards one end of this section of the park is a concrete-domed stage, surrounded by thick scrub."

    "Rows of concrete benches make up an outdoor auditorium, eerily empty save for the pair of us."

    hi "I don't know if we'll be able to find a seat."

    "Hanako doesn't reply, but I feel her shoulders jitter in a silent laugh."

    "I wonder… how long has she been internalising things like this?"

    "Has she always just laughed to herself?"

    "It dawns upon me that, beyond her visible scarring, I know so little about Hanako."

    "It's… saddening."

    ha "I think anywhere will be fine…"

    "Even though she says that, it stills takes us a while to actually find a seat."

    "Possibly, neither of us wants to let go of the other."

    "Strangely, the bench we eventually decide upon is in the centre of the rearmost row, as if we were avoiding the phantoms on the stage."

    "We sit against each other, and spread the meagre pickings from the convenience store across our laps."

    "Using our food as an excuse, we sit and watch the silent stage."

    "A gentle breeze blows the auditorium, kicking up some leaves into a pantomime dance across the stage."

    "I watch a pair of leaves drift together, dancing around each other on the wind, only to be finally blown apart."

    "One tumbles to the ground, whilst the other is caught by an eddy and trapped inside the dome of the stage."

    "So entranced by this strange dance am I that I don't notice that Hanako has stopped eating."

    "She's holding her sandwich, half eaten, at chest height, her eyes glazed, staring into infinity."

    hi "H… Hanako?"

    hi "Hanako?!"

    "I stand up violently, throwing half-eaten food across the benches in front of me."

    "Grasping Hanako's shoulders, I fall to my knees to draw level with her intense stare."

    hi "Hanako? What's wrong? Say something!"

    "It's no good, she seems to have gone catatonic on me."

    hi "Hanako! Please! Talk to me!"

    "Panic grips at my gut, twisting it into great knots."

    "I can feel my heart thumping ever faster in my chest."

    "I know I should calm down, but I just can't."

    "Before my very eyes, Hanako seems to be having some kind of attack."

    "But what to do? What can I do?"

    "I don't even know what's wrong with her, let alone how to help her."

    "Should I call an ambulance?"

    "Surely they know what to do."

    "I try to stand, but the furious beating of my heart and the surging adrenaline cause me to falter and nearly fall."

    "But before I can recover and stand properly, I feel a pressure upon my shoulder, forcing me back to my knees."

    "I look up…"

    "…straight into Hanako's tear-stained eyes."

    "For a moment, silence."

    "Even the light breeze seems to stop."

    ha "I…"

    ha "I was…"

    ha "I was in the fire."

    "The wind takes its cue and blows Hanako's hair from her face, exposing it's scarred side."

    ha "I… I was six, and I was in the fire…"

    "Even a fool could see the pain Hanako was suffering now, so I do the only thing I know how."

    "I pull her into my embrace, and whisper in her ear."

    hi "I know… you told me the first week we met, remember?"

    hi "…that you were in a fire as a kid…"

    "I hear a soft sob in my ear and feel her head rub against me as she shakes her head."

    ha "No… not a fire… the fire…"

    ha "…the fire that… the fire that…"

    "Hanako takes a deep breath inwards, and her voice lowers in pitch."

    ha "The fire that killed everyone."

    "The wind picks up again, this time totally blowing Hanako's hair away from her face…"

    "… as she leans back and kisses me."

    #Hate me all you will, but this is a CG moment; Hair flowing back in the wind, face
    #revealed, holding Hisao's head as the pash on. Hawtness required.

    "I try to respond, but find myself simply kissing her back, my lips feeling hers, the raw emotion of the moment flowing from her like a font."

    "…"

    "We stay like this for an eternity, our bodies pressed together, Hanako leaning forward off the bench into me on my knees."

    "Eventually, when it seems that the depths of Hanako's emotions have been plumbed, she releases me and sits back upon the bench…"

    "… where she starts to giggle."

    hi "W…what?"

    "Hanako's titter rapidly turns into laughter, revealing an expression on Hanako that I've never seen before."

    hi "What? Did I… um…"

    "I can see Hanako trying to speak, but she can't seem to talk around her own laughter."

    "Eventually, she manages to control herself for long enough to point at my chest."

    "Looking down, I find the remains of her lunch ground into my shirt."

    #I'm not sure if this section is to corny/slapstick, but basically I want to have Hanako
    #showing her patented yandere mood swing ability.

    "Shit."

    "I forgot about that."

    "But the sudden release of tension and the wave of emotions running through my mind render me as incapable as Hanako."

    "I try to scrape the ruined sandwich from me, which simply serves to grind it further into my clothes, and amuse Hanako."

    "Once I've managed to clean myself as much as possible, I start to gather up the food I scattered in my initial arising."

    "Hanako continues to giggle, albeit more subdued, and helps me gather the refuse."

    ha "Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you before."

    hi "Oh… not at all… I just… I just…"

    "I don't even know what I wanted to do."

    hi "I guess I just wanted to be there for you."

    ha "Well, thank you for that."

    ha "I can't just talk to anyone, so I'm glad that you were here."

    hi "N… not at all."

    "I can't believe Hanako is taking this so well."

    "She's practically glowing with confident happiness."

    "Meanwhile, here's me, stuttering like… like…"

    "Well, like Hanako."

    "I chuckle to myself at the thought."

    ha "Eh? What's the matter?"

    hi "Heh, I was just thinking that it's like you and I swapped roles since… since we…"

    "Oh lords, I can even feel myself blushing."

    #hanako bright smile

    "Hanako, obviously following my thoughts to their conclusion, reaches up and pecks me on the lips."

    ha "There, that's twice, so we should be back to normal now, right?"

    hi "Right. I think."

    hi "Should we try and find a place for all this?"

    "I raise the plastic bag full of rubbish up to emphasize my point."

    ha "Okay. There should be a bin on the way to the station."

    "For the first time in a while, I check my watch."

    hi "You're right, it is starting to get late, we should make a move."

    "Hanako nods, and clutches onto my left arm, resting her head on my shoulder."

    ha "Say… would you like to come over to Lilly's tonight?"

    hi "I would love to, but I want to get a change of clothes first."

    #Hanako giggle

    ha "That's a good idea."

    "We step out of the concealed auditorium and back into the park proper."

    "As we do, I feel Hanako's grip tighten slightly, but as I steal a glance down at her face I note that she hasn't lost the radiance from our kiss."

    "Luckily, we find a bin fairly quickly, and I reach across myself to rest my now free hand upon Hanako's arm."

    #Time passage of some kind. I want to do the next part, but it's not big enough for it's
    #own scene.

    "Hanako and I say our goodbyes at the dorms, and I promise to go to Lilly's room as soon as I can."

    "I don't think I've ever bathed and changed into new clothes so quickly before."

    "Even so, our late return from the city means that it's almost seven by the time I knock gently on Lilly's door."

    li "Who is it?"

    hi "Er, it's Hisao. Can I come in yet?"

    li "Yet? Whatever do you mean? But please do, the door is unlocked."

    "I turn the door knob, and it is indeed unlocked."

    li "Good evening, Hisao. What brings you here?"

    hi "Um, Hanako invited me over for tea, so I came as soon as I could…"

    li "Hanako did? But I haven't seen her since she returned…"

    hi "That's… strange…"

    li "Indeed it is. Shall we check on her?"

    "Bad feelings and doubt start churning my stomach."

    "Maybe Hanako wasn't as radiant as I initially thought…"

    hi "I think we should…"

    "I lead Lilly to the door, and out into the corridor."

    "After a single step, I can see that Hanako's door is ajar."

    "I lurch forward, and pull Lilly with me, who stumbles at the change in pace."

    "Pushing open the door, I call out…"

    hi "Hanako?"

    "Hanako lies on her bed, still dressed in the same clothes, curled tightly around the tattered plush bunny that is the only decoration in her room."

    "She doesn't even stir at the mention of her name, but I can swear I see a smile on her face."

    li "What's going on Hisao? Is something the matter?"

    hi "Shhhh…"

    "I quietly silence Lilly, and gently close Hanako's door."

    hi "Sorry about that, she was sleeping."

    li "Oh, I apologize. Did we wake her?"

    hi "I don't think so,"

    #lilly relieved.

    li "Oh, good."

    #Lilly, curious.

    li "Although, I must ask… why would she be so tired after just a single day with you?"

    "My mind instantly recalls Hanako's impassioned kiss in the amphitheatre… and her words just before it."

    hi "Er… it was nothing, really, but can I ask you something? In, er, private?"

    li "But of course. Please, come in."

    "For the second time, I enter Lilly's room."

    "As if following some kind of programme, I turn on her little kettle in preparation."

    li "Thank you, Hisao. Now, tell me, what's on your mind?"

    hi "Well, it's something Hanako told me."

    hi "She said she was in “The” fire…"

    hi "“The fire that killed everyone.”"

    #Lilly concerned/ deep in thought.

    li "Oh… she told you about that."

    li "I guess there's no harm in telling you, then."

    li "You'll recall that I mentioned that Hanako was an orphan, yes?"

    hi "Yeah, you told me on your yacht."

    li "Well, she was orphaned in the same fire that gave her those scars."

    li "Her mother was killed instantly, they say."

    li "Her father lasted a week before succumbing to his burns."

    hi "You… you're kidding…"

    li "I am afraid not."

    hi "But she said she got her burns as a child… so, all this time…"

    li "I'm afraid so…"

    "We sit in silence. The kettle boils and shuts off, but still, we just sit."

    li "I'm not sure what occurred between you two today, but I will assume that it was of some importance."

    li "And I'm… glad that you're concerned for her."

    li "I'm afraid that I may not be the best person to help her."

    li "But you, on the other hand… you…"

    "Lilly searches for an appropriate phrasing for what seems to be her version of stating the obvious."

    li "…you are probably the person best suited for her."

    hi "Thanks. I think."

    li "Would you like a cup of tea?"

    hi "Actually, I think I might have an early night too."

    hi "I'm surprisingly tired now."

    nk "No, no, not at all. I just wanted to make sure that you were adapting well enough."

    nk "How's your medication?"

    hi "It tastes like citric acid… or something. Really bitter…"

    nk "Well, your heart has no tastebuds, so I doubt the chemists ever thought it that important."

    hi "Nothing more or less than before, I guess."

    nk "And how's life in general? Settled in well enough?"

    hi "I guess so."

    nk "Well, I've heard that you've already made a few, well, friends."

    nk "I think we can leave it at that, for now."

    hi "Eh? Do you mean Hanako?"

    "The nurse smiles."

    nk "Thanks for confirming that. My source wasn't too sure of the details."

    nk "She just thought that “the new guy got himself a girlfriend.”"

    "Even the staff know about us? This school certainly is fond of scuttlebutt…"

    hi "Um, well… is that not allowed?"

    "The nurse laughs heartily at my remark."

    nk "Of course it's allowed. You're just kids, after all."

    nk "Just don't do anything that makes more work for me, ok?"

    nk "But still, you said Hanako, right?"

    nk "That would be Hanako Ikezawa, correct?"

    hi "Yeah. But we've only been going out a few days, so it's not like we'd do… that kind of thing…"

    "The nurse smirks to himself."

    nk "Oh, I know just how fast things can move when you're full of hormones."

    nk "Remember, I'm trained in this kind of thing."

    "Did he just wink at me?"

    nk "But I digress. It's interesting that you and Hanako found each other."

    hi "Interesting? How?"

    nk "Well, your cases are similar, in a way."

    nk "Unlike someone born with a disability, you both had to overcome your hardships in your adolescence."

    nk "And in many ways, that can be much more challenging."

    nk "You could both probably learn a lot of each other."

    nk "Anyway, let's get down to it. Your doctor has requested that I send him your vitals."

    nk "So, off with your shirt, I need to have a listen to this heart of yours…"

    "Obediently, and still trying to decipher the nurse's words, I remove my shirt."

    "The nurse knows his stuff, to. He rubs the stethoscope against his coat to warm it a little before listening."

    "Only a few of the nurses knew that trick in the hospital, and none of the doctors."

    "It's strange how you remember little things like that."

    "The measurements only take a few moments, and I replace my shirt as the nurse scribbles his findings on his notepad."

    nk "Well, I think that's about it."

    nk "You should consider yourself lucky. A lot of people on the meds you're on get some pretty bad teething troubles whilst the dose is sorted out."

    nk "But for now, you should probably focus on your exams. They're coming up, you know?"

    hi "Eh? Really? I didn't think they were for a fortnight…"

    "I wonder what the girls think of him?"

    "The trip back to class is slightly lonely."

    "It's rare to see the halls this empty during the day."

    "I'm more used to the bustle of the lunch hour rush."

    "Theoretically, I should head straight back into class, but this is a golden opportunity."

    "If I shy away from class, I can be first in line at lunch."

    "The thought of snatching up some of the rarer treats makes my mouth water."

    "I'm sure Hanako and Lilly would appreciate the effort, too."

    "It also gives me a little time to ponder the nurse's words."

    "He said that both Hanako and I had to overcome our problems later in life."

    #Hopefully, by now, wheels are starting to turn; Hanako not coming to the school until
    #middle school, the nurse saying "adolescent"…
    #If this isn't as obvious as I think it is, please let me know.

    "I guess there's not that much difference between a six-year-old and a adolescent."

    "He was probably just making generalisations."

    "Anyway, the Great Hall has only just opened for lunch."

    "If I hurry, I can grab some food and make it back to the class before Hanako even gets out of her chair."

    "Like an eagle spotting its prey, I swoop through the {a=LolReplace}serving line{/a} and secure three of the legendary yakisoba breads."

    "The bells for lunch ring just as I'm reaching the door to the class…"

    hi "Crap…"

    "Before I can take a step backwards, the door flies open and I'm suddenly staring into a ravenous horde…"

    "…and carrying three of the most desirable items from the Great Hall."

    "It's like taking a meat tray into a lion's den."

    "I vainly attempt to hide the bread by holding them to my chest."

    "The onslaught of hungry students presses straight into me, and I am buffeted against the far wall of the hall."

    "Eventually, the tide slows a little as the less mobile students start to make their exit, and I manage to squeeze past into the classroom."

    "As expected, Hanako is still sitting at her desk, staring listlessly into the classroom's rear doorway, where Lilly usually makes her entrance."

    "I manage to get fairly close before she notices."

    ha "Hisao… you came back…"

    hi "Well, what did you expect? I wasn't going to leave you here…"

    "I unfold my arms, revealing the treasure contained within:"

    "Three crushed yakisoba breads."

    #Hanako shy giggle

    ha "Did you do that just for me?"

    hi "What? Oh…"

    "I look at my chest, to find the remains of one of the bread rolls smeared against my shirt."

    hi "Ah, what a coincidence…"

    li "What's a coincidence?"

    ha "It's.. um… nothing."

    li "Splendid! What did you make, Hisao?"

    hi "Ah, I actually bought these, but they're yakisoba breads."

    hi "I've never had one…"

    ha "N… neither have I."

    li "I must admit that I have had one previously, but only once."

    li "That you could secure more than one is admirable, Hisao."

    hi "Well, I kinda had to skip class to get them, but I really did have to go the nurse's office…"

    #Lilly concerned

    li "My my, are you not feeling well?"

    hi "It's not that, he just wanted to check up on me."

    hi "Anyway, let's go eat these… or what's left of them."

    "We make our way to the roof as a trio. Treasures like these can't be eaten in public."

    "Visions creep into my head of habitual yakisoba bread eaters digging caves behind the dorms so they can enjoy their food."

    "Or of huge syndicates that form to ensure that they will always get the bread."

    "I'm imagining a mob boss, controlling the bread flow throughout the school."

    "I wonder if my actions today will create a deficit and send rival gangs into battle?"

    "Curious, I take a quick peek through the chicken-wire fence at the school's grounds."

    "I can't see any gun battles raging; the bread routes must be severely underground."

    ha "What are you looking for, Hisao?"

    "I didn't even notice Hanako standing next to me, but here she is, pressed against the fence, as if she were trying to help me search."

    hi "Er, underground bread wars."

    #Hanako concerned

    "In retaliation, the trees scratch out their marks on the sky, endlessly thrusting upwards at their own pace."

    "And here, in the midst of this epic, ageless battle, the three of us sit and eat Lilly's lunch."

    "She was right; there's far too much food here for three people."

    "Bread of all shapes and sizes, onigiri, pre-packed bentos… it's like she went to a convenience store and just bought everything she could."

    "Hanako leans across my body to gain access to her foodstuffs of choice, and lingers slightly."

    "I must admit, I too am relishing the contact."

    "The nurse's words reverberate in my head; maybe the two of us are really helping each other."

    "Hanako is obviously more open to me, and I can't help but feel relaxed in her presence."

    "The three of us chatter mindlessly whist eating, mostly about the upcoming exams and our strategies to combat them."

    hi "Should we make the evening study a regular event?"

    "Scooping all of the wrappers and left overs into the plastic bag, I search out a garbage bin."

    hi "Come on, let's go back and fetch Lilly before lunch ends, eh?"

    ha "O…okay."

    "As, I return to the garden, Hanako takes my hand shyly."

    "The combination of the sun overhead, the soft grass underfoot and the dainty hand entwined with mine puts a strange spring in my step."

    "The coming exams, the mound of medications I take, all of my problems…"

    "… just seem to be so insignificant when compared to this moment."

    "We gather Lilly into our party, and head back towards our classes."

    #passage of time.

    "After class, Hanako and I embark on our journey to Aura-Mart."

    "From the moment we step out of the classroom, our hands are firmly wrapped around each other."

    "We pass through the school's gates and into the wide world, and instantly Hanako moves even closer to my side."

    "I suppose she is who she is; it'll take her a long time to stop fearing each and every person."

    "We receive a few curious looks and the occasional jeer from fellow students also making their way into town."

    "It would seem that our infamy knows no bounds."

    "Not that I'm complaining. Better to be known for going out with a girl than for acting like a fool… or something."

    "Inside the small convenience store, Hanako takes up position directly behind me, gently tugging on the back of my shirt."

    "The store is crowded with students flicking through magazines and stocking up on snack foods, and occasionally we are buffeted in the flow."

    "Every time we get bumped by another customer, I feel the tender tug from my rear tighten into a vice-grip."

    "It was probably a bad idea to bring Hanako here."

    "Hurriedly, I grab a hold of a number of tasty items within my immediate vicinity and head for the exit."

    "Once we get outside, Hanako immediately returns to my side, buries her face into the side of my chest and hugs my waist with both arms."

    "We walk the short distance back to the school like this, and the strange stares from the students passing by seem to intensify."

    "High school students holding hands is on thing; this level of intimacy is slightly over the top."

    "Doubtless the Silent Wonder and her Pink Haired Accomplice will have something to say about this tomorrow."

    "Suddenly, I start seeing everyone around me as a spy; willing to report this latest behaviour to anyone who cares."

    "Ah well, who am I to complain? I'm happy, Hanako's happy, so who the hell cares?"

    "We re-enter the school, and Hanako releases her grip slightly."

    hi "You okay there?"

    ha "Y…yeah."

    hi "Sorry, I didn't realise that there would be so many people."

    hi "And you too, I thought that you had things to do?"

    li "It's quite alright, it really wasn't a bother."

    hi "Okay… but next time, let us know, please."

    "Again, we settle into our studies."

    "Tonight's main topic is science, and my turn to teach the girls."

    "Lilly seems to need the most help, and Hanako simply commits herself to her work."

    "Occasionally, she'll ask me to help her on a question, then go back to working quietly."

    "I'm amazed at her concentration."

    "I struggle to remember the exact words. My memories are focused intently on what happened after her words, not the words themselves."

    #Lilly contemplates

    li "Well, this may just be me worrying too much, but it seems that Hanako isn't talking to anyone anymore."

    hi "That's crazy; she's talking to me more and more. And you know how we act here; the old Hanako would never let me hug her…"

    li "But that's only when it's just the two of you."

    li "The last two nights, she's barely said a word here."

    li "And when you leave, she just goes straight to her room."

    li "We haven't talked since your date."

    "Worry hits me like a barbed arrow to the gut."

    "I was thinking that Hanako was doing well, but, if so, why would she stop talking to Lilly?"

    "Something doesn't add up, but my brain is too full of the past few night's study and Lilly's confession for me to piece everything together."

    hi "Something's missing."

    li "Pardon?"

    hi "There's something here that I'm missing, I know it."

    hi "Surely Hanako thinks you're a friend, right?"

    li "I believe so, yes."

    "Half-formed ideas surface into my consciousness, but as I reach out for them they dissolve."

    "I sigh, resigned."

    hi "I… don't think there's a problem."

    hi "Maybe you're just worrying too much, but she seems fine around me."

    hi "And… I like her. No, I love her."

    hi "I'm not going to let anyone hurt her. If she only talks to me, then that's fine, right?"

    hi "I mean, we both know she's shy, but she'll get over that slowly, right?"

    hi "She did with me, after all."

    "Lilly concedes defeat."

    li "You may be right."

    li "Maybe I was just too used to her only talking to me."

    li "But please, keep an eye on her."

    li "She is a dear friend."

    hi "I will."

    "For a moment, we sit in silence, contemplating our mutual friend."

    "Maybe Hanako was a lot dearer to Lilly than I expected."

    "And I can see Lilly's concern, too."

    "Hanako and I have been spending a lot of time together, and we've grown closer."

    "I can only imagine that I'd also feel worried about her if we started talking less."

    "Eventually, she returns from her ablutions and sits next to me."

    "I gently pat her on the head, and she returns my gesture with a smile."

    "There's no way that beaming face could be regressing. I'd never seen Hanako smile like this before we started going out."

    "Surely that's progress."

    "Right?"

    "Something niggles in the back of my mind, something that I've overlooked without realising."

    "I attribute it to studying too hard, and go back to helping Lilly with her problem."

    #ftb and such.

    "Once again, Hanako beats me to the dorm's front door."

    hi "Well, you've got me again."

    #Hanako giggle

    ha "I thought you might have tried to trick me, so I made sure I was here early."

    "Early? It's barley quarter past seven… just how early is she getting up for this little game?"

    hi "That's impressive, but you don't need to kill yourself just to win, you know."

    ha "You're just saying that so you can win."

    hi "Well, maybe a little. But really, we all need to sleep."

    "I decide to drop the matter. She's not hurting anyone, and I must admit, having a pretty face waiting for me every morning is a great motivator."

    "At lunch, Lilly once again finds us in the classroom."

    li "Hisao, Hanako… are you both free after classes?"

    hi "As far as I know, Hanako?"

    "Hanako nods"

    hi "That's a yes too, what's on your mind?"

    li "Well, I was also free, and I thought that it might be nice to relax our studies for a couple of hours to visit a café."

    li "Seeing as our usual ceremony has been so rudely interrupted…"

    ha "I… I want to go too."

    "Lilly and I sigh a breath of relief together."

    ha "Sorry. I just… was thinking about something."

    "Hanako meekly smiles at Lilly and I, but in her eyes I sense a strange melancholy."

    "Quickly checking to make sure the classroom is empty, I bend down and kiss her forehead."

    hi "It'll be fine, nothing to worry about, 'kay?"

    hi "Let's all go out and have a bit of fun."

    hi "It might be the last chance we have before exams, right?"

    yu "Really? The boss keeps on yelling at me, but thanks, Lilly."

    yu "Is there anything else?"

    ha "No."

    "Yuuko, Lilly and I all turn to face Hanako, who is clutching my arm."

    "But, beneath that, a fierce, quivering mouth sits."

    hi "Hanako?"

    yu "I… I see… sorry to disturb you."

    mu "That's six and a half school days."

    mu "However, it should be worth noting that anything you don't know the night before you probably won't know on the day."

    mu "Also, by cramming for your test, you are prone to increase your own stress levels."

    mu "Without getting into details, I should mention that excess stress will release a number of chemicals into your brain."

    mu "One of the side effects of this is that you will no longer be able to access things in your long term memory."

    mu "If you cram, you will have trouble remembering the things in your long-term memory."

    "After taking stock of what he just said, he smiles to himself, feeling that he has done the students a great service."

    "However, the students don't seem as pleased as he is."

    "Panic etches itself upon the faces of the students that were planning to do exactly that."

    "The students who study for lengthy periods in advance are also starting to look around warily."

    "In short, Muto has, single-handedly, crushed the hope of every student in the room."

    "Focus."

    "Focus only on the present."

    "We'll sort these things out in the future. For now, be happy in the fact that Hanako is back to normal."

    hi "You're right though. It's maddeningly hot out there."

    hi "I don't think I could have gone much further."

    hi "And the humidity…"

    ha "That's the bad part."

    li "Quite right. It's much harder to deal with high humidity than high temperature."

    hi "I wonder if that's why people can stand living in the desert."

    li "Perhaps."

    ha "But no-one really lives in the desert."

    ha "People live near rivers. Always."

    hi "I suppose you're right there, rivers or some other water source."

    "As we contemplate the fates of desert people, Yuuko approaches carrying a large plastic jug."

    "The ice cubes inside it rattle out some strange melody, and I wonder, briefly, if that kind of noise has inspired any of Hanako's favourite songs."

    "Melodic or not, the iced tea is just the elixir for a day like this."

    hi "Lilly, commendations on the choice of drink."

    ha "It's good."

    li "Yes, you simply cannot beat iced jasmine tea on a day like this."

    "By the time Yuuko arrives with the platter of cut sandwiches, the large plastic jug is empty."

    yu "Would you like another jug?"

    li "I think we should be fine for the moment."

    yu "Oh, okay."

    yu "If you need me, please just call."

    "As Yuuko turns from us, the door of the café opens, and a gust of wind blows in behind a pair of new customers."

    "Yuuko rushes to serve them, but Lilly looks slightly worried."

    li "Hisao, would I be right in thinking that outside it is now fairly windy?"

    hi "Huh?"

    "I take a glance out of the window, and notice the tops of distant trees waving about."

    hi "Yeah, it looks like it."

    #Lilly frown.

    li "Did anyone bring an umbrella?"

    hi "Um, no. Hanako?"

    ha "N… no. What's the matter Lilly?"

    "Lilly sighs."

    li "I hope I'm wrong, but I think we may be in for a bit of a storm this afternoon."

    hi "How do you know?"

    li "With this heat and humidity, there's always a fair chance."

    li "The wind is one of the last phases."

    li "I'm afraid we may be trapped here for some time."

    "Sure enough, as Lilly finishes lamenting, another group of customers enters the store."

    "Customer 1" "Looks like rain out there."

    "Customer 2" "And heavy at that…"

    "Hanako and I gawk at Lilly in amazement."

    $doublespeak (hi, ha, "How did you know?")

    li "It's simple meteorology. We covered it in science last trimester."

    hi "That makes sense, it seems very much like something Muto would teach."

    "I get a chuckle from Hanako and Lilly."

    ha "But… we can stay here… right?"

    hi "I guess so. It doesn't look like there's many people here."

    "At that moment, the first splats of rain start to be heard overhead."

    "Even the un-Muto-trained ear can tell that these are not your ordinary, petite raindrops."

    "They sound fat, ferocious, and incessant."

    li "Hisao, could you please call Yuuko over?"

    "I gesture to the flippant waitress and she comes immediately."

    yu "Can I help?"

    li "Yuuko, would you happen to have any spare umbrellas here?"

    "Yuuko looks deep in thought for a time."

    yu "No, however it looks like it just started raining."

    yu "So, if you came back tomorrow, people will probably leave some here today."

    "…"

    "Even Lilly appears flabbergasted at this answer, and the fact that it is entirely correct."

    li "I see. I shall keep that in mind."

    li "Could I please order a pot of black tea and some cakes then?"

    yu "Right away!"

    "Yuuko scurries away to do what she does best; approximating a waitress."

    li "I suppose we should just try and wait it out."

    ha "Okay. I don't mind staying here."

    hi "Sounds like a plan then."

    "The barrage of rain intensifies until all that can be heard is white noise around us."

    "Occasionally, a peel of thunder rolls through the café."

    "However, the storm has an unexpected affect."

    "Shortly after the rain reaches what seems like its peak, the door to the café opens."

    "The noise of the rain seems to double instantly, and a howling wind rips around the small room, blowing menus around in a mini cyclone."

    "But the most disturbing thing to pass through the door is a troupe of soaking, young teenage boys."

    "There's about fifteen of them in all, in soccer uniform, all panting from the mad run here."

    "They must have been caught out during practice, and made a bolt for here, knowing that it would be relatively dry."

    "However, the little café isn't the world's largest eatery, and the soccer team quickly crowds it."

    "Excited, panting voices drown out the noise of the rain, and Yuuko goes into some kind of overload and tries to serve them all at once."

    "But all of that is a secondary issue."

    "Hanako, who had been relatively relaxed until now, is clutching onto my arm with a vice-grip."

    "Her head is bowed lower that I've ever seen it before, and her eyes are fixated, unblinking, in some kind of terror."

    hi "Hanako? Hanako?!"

    "I try to shake her shoulder, then I try to hold her, but to no avail."

    "She is as solid as a rock, and half as responsive."

    li "Hisao? Is something the matter? What's going on?"

    hi "It's Hanako… she's… she's… oh hell, I don't know… Hanako!"

    "She grabs her ears, and shrieks."

    "The ear-piercing shriek silences the howling boys."
