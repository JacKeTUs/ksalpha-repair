    "Taking the side of her face in the palm of her hand, her delicate pale lips brush those of Hanako."

    "Hanako's body relaxes, and for a fleeting second, Lilly's breath gently caresses her face."

    "As she pulls back, Hanako returns her gentle gaze."

    "Lilly leans in for another kiss."

    "This time though, it overflows with passion, a lustful grab for Hanako's breath."

    ha "Mmmmm… Mmm…"

    "Lilly's lust flows over into Hanako, the last vestiges of resistance dissolving in the onslaught."

    "What was a trickle of desire is now a raging torrent of passion, the atmosphere between the two changing perceptibly."

    "Hanako slowly raises her arms to hold Lilly's snow-white back, her fingers as touching the flawless skin of her pale shoulderblades."

    "Slowly withdrawing her lips from those of Hanako, Lilly slowly lowers herself to Hanako's full breasts."

    "The hands on Lilly's back helplessly slide off and onto the bed, the gaze of her companion transfixed upon her."

    li "My my, Hanako, such a beautiful body…"

    "A deep breath is the only answer to be given, and the only answer required."

    "She brings her mouth to the nipple of Hanako's right breast, her body tensing slightly as she does."

    "Sliding her mouth over, she closes her eyes as she savours the slight texture."

    "Hanako's breathing becomes deeper as she gently moves her lips left to right, the half-erect nipple giving slightly each way."

    "A slight shudder hails Lilly's tongue touching the tip, affectionately toying with it in her mouth."

    "Backwards and forwards, she gently moves her tongue over the delicate nub, wettening it as it grows ever-so-slightly."

    "She pulls back, sliding her hand back over the wettened breast and smoothly fondling it as she places a featherlike kiss between her soft, smooth breasts."

    li "Hanako, you're so beautiful…"

    ha "L… Lilly… Mmm… please, stop…"

    "Ignoring her objections, she moves her head down Hanako's body, sliding her hand down her side."

    "Affectionately pecking the smooth chest of Hanako as she goes, her last kiss is atop the whispy field between her legs."

    "As a pale hand makes its way around her pronounced curves, Hanako's breath catches as it passes her hip and stops at her thigh."

    "Shuffling backward, Lilly frees her other hand and gently feels down the left side just as smoothly as the right."

    "With the gentleness of a mother nursing a newborn, she rubs the outside of Hanako's legs."

    ha "Mm… Li… Lilly… please…"

    "Her hands gripping the pale white sheets, her breathing becomes even more uneven than before."

    li "My my, you're so sensitive, Hanako."

    ha "L—lilly… Mmm…"

    li "You're so cute, Hanako."

    "Circling her hands on the inside of Hanako's thighs, she gently moves her head forward."

    "Her face makes its way towards the delicate folds between Hanako's legs, already well-dampened."

    "A moment's pause, the labored breathing from above only heightening the excitement, before she moveds forward that last inch."

    "She delicately brings her tongue to the delicate nub in front of her, expertly finding it within the folds of skin."

    ha "Ah! Mmm… p—please… Mmmmn…"

    "Barely able to form a sentence, she surrenders herself to the trickle of pleasure from below, gripping the sheets ever tighter."

    ha "Mmm… Nnn… H—Hah…"

    "Lilly gently removes a hand from atop its resting place, cupping two fingers below her mouth."

    "She pushes them forward slowly, past the initial resistance of her wettened outside."

    ha "Ah, n—no! Please… ah… hah…"

    "As they move in, they give an unrefined, sloppy sound, contrasting to the barely audible licking of her tongue."

    "Once inside they easily move inwards, the warmth from the soft, wet skin almost welcoming them inside."

    "Hanako's delicate body moves slightly on the stained sheets in rythm with the gentle lapping over her most delicate area."

    "As she slowly moves her fingers outwards and inwards, Lilly's cheeks become even more flushed than before, all the more visible on her pale white skin."

    li "My my… Hana… chan…"

    "The excitement flowing into her breathless speech, she squirms her legs, the wetness of her thighs telling of her unbridled lust."

    ha "L—Lilly… Mmmmm… Nn…"

    "Hanako's voice takes on a sharper edge, her excitement rising rapidly."

    ha "Ah, ah, Lilly… ah! Aaaah!"

    li "It's alright, Hanako… Whenever you want to…"

    ha "Ah!… Ah… Nnnnn…"

    "She begins to squirm in excitement, her thoughts frantic and incoherent."

    ha "Lilly! Ah! Aaaah!"

    "Lilly raises her head one final time, taking pleasure from the rapture so tangibly close."

    "She withdraws her tongue and stills her fingers for a second before unleashing an assault upon Hanako's senses, her tongue vibrating quickly."

    ha "Ah! Lilly, I'm… Ah! Aaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!"

    "To say he fits the look of his surroundings would be a good description."

    "I politely nod and turn to look around the store."

    "It's quite a bit larger than it looked from the outside, with three large shelves in the middle and wide tables around the outside."

    "Slowly walking and crouching down, I examine the table inside the shop window."

    "At least thirty small dolls, each about the size of an outstretched hand. There doesn't seem to be much variety in terms of make, all of them being ceramic and designed in the same way."

    "The only thing that separates them is their clothing, which spans all the colors of the rainbow and every time period from baroque to modern."

    "Even to my untrained eye, they're of exquisite quality."

    "Putting my tongue to me cheek in thought, I carefully take the price tag attached by a string to one of them to see the price."

    "I didn't see any in her room the last time I was in there, from memory, despite seeing a good number of porclain dolls, so I guess it's unlikely Hanako would give her one."

    "I look at them closely, occasionally giving them a light rub to see how they feel."

    "One in particular stands out, extremely soft to the touch and well-made."

    "Taking a hold of the tag, I note the name written in cursive English."

    "Steiff… I've heard of that somewhere."

    "As soon as I flip it over though, a familiar pang of disappointment rises again."

    "Damnit."

    "Is there anything in this cursed store I can actually afford?"

    "Though, I guess it's less the store's fault and more mine for having such a paltry budget."

    "Pocket money can only go so far, and my meds cost a rediculous amount to start with."

    "I walk around to the table at the far end of the store, this time covered by all manner of wooden clocks."

    "Furrowing my brow as I crouch, I closely examine one that catches my eye."

    "A miniature grandfather clock, complete with moving pendulum."

    "Inside the small glass bubble are the brass minute and hour hands, intricate designs engraved on both."

    "I can only stare at the workmanship that's gone into such a beautiful thing, and for a moment forget the reason I even came into the store."

    "After a minute or two of staring though, I manage to recollect myself, standing and taking a gander at the shelf behind me."

    "Woodcrafts—posable dolls, small kid's toys and sculptures—populate it."

    "As I look through them though, I notice a small box tucked away behind a toy car."

    "I gingerly reach back and pull it out, admiring the intricately carved patterns on the dark, varnished wood as I do."

    "Despite his hands looking frail and old, he guides the drill with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel."

    "For him, this is a labor of love."

    "I smile, though even as I do the corner of my mouth falters."

    "It must be nice to have something to devote oneself wholeheartedly to."

    "To find something that you take joy in doing, no matter how many years you spend doing it."

    "As the noise suddenly trails off, I come to my senses."

    "To be having such thoughts while shopping in town."

    "How rediculous."

    "He gently blows on the bass plate, small shavings flying onto the desk in front of him, and hoists it above his face to inspect closely."

    "Shopkeeper" "Well, that should be it. Want to take a look?"

    "I walk up and take the music box, turning it over to admire his handiwork."

    "Shopkeeper" "Hmm… Well, if it's for a little lass, I can't see how I could ask for more than five thousand, five hundred yen."

    "I breath a sigh of relief."

    "It's obvious it really costs more."

    hi "It's fine. What's wrong with your scooter?"

    yu "Hmm? Ah, this thing."

    "We both look down at it, the small black engine visible thanks to a small rectangular panel having been removed from the side underneath the seat and placed placed on the ground beside it."

    yu "I was finally going home after a damned long day at work and it broke down. Again. For the fifth time this month."

    hi "Want some help? I'm no mechanic, but I guess another look wouldn't hurt."

    "No mechanic is putting it lightly. I know what each part does and where it goes… roughly."

    "Still, I can't just leave her stranded here without at least trying to help."

    yu "Well, you're welcome to look at it. I doubt it'll do much good though."

    "We both crouch down, with me carefully setting the bag in my hand aside whilst crouching to avoid my uniform getting stained."

    hi "Okay, let's have a look here."

    "First thing's first, there's a fan."

    "I guess that cools the engine."

    "I gently reach in and move it back and forward a bit with my finger."

    "Okay, it's moving. Next."

    "There's a wire coming out the top, so I suppose that goes to the spark plug."

    hi "Spark plug okay?"

    yu "Yep, switched it out and still no luck."

    hi "Hmm…"

    "I return to trying my hardest to look like I know what I'm doing."

    "This is hopeless."

    "I guess it's worth checking the basics, just to make sure."

    hi "Does it start at all?"

    yu "Yeah, it starts, sputters a bit and then dies."

    "She takes her hair with both her oil-stained hands and ruffs it up in frustration."

    "Now she's got both messed-up and oiled-up hair."

    "I quickly distract myself to stop from laughing."

    hi "Um, okay, could you start it so I can hear what it does?"

    yu "Sure, hold on a sec."

    "Oh God, please let it be something simple, please, please, please."

    "She walks around me and starts the engine in short measure."

    "Huh. Everything looks fine."

    "I stand up and walk around to her, glancing over her shoulder at the dials on the handles."

    "My expression becomes flat."

    hi "Yuuko."

    yu "Yeah?"

    hi "Look at the fuel guage."

    yu "Hmm?"

    "I can barely force the words out through my lungs being forced inwards."

    "Even as I say that though, I can't help but notice a small detail."

    "Or rather, two small details."

    yu "Ah, sorry, I got overexcited. I always do that, ah, sorry! I'm sorry!"

    "Her eyes suddenly focus on the almost completely hidden watch on my wrist."

    yu "Ah! The time!"

    "She quickly looks back to the handle on the Vespa, a small digital clock that's obviously tacked on by tape being precariously attached to it."

    yu "Uwah! I need to go, I need to go now!"

    hi "Uh… huh."

    "I raise an eyebrow, reduced to merely watching this hopeless girl."

    "Ducking down, she expertly places the removed panel back in place as I stare worryingly at the fact she screws in the four corner screws with nothing but her fingers to tighten them."

    "Seemingly not noticing my apprehension, she grabs her red and white helmet from the far handle and slides it onto her head, leaving the straps to dangle uselessly beside her face."

    "A green Vespa, and a white helmet with a red stripe down the middle."

    "It's worrying that a blind person has better color coordination than she does."

    yu "Yo, Hisao?"

    hi "Yeah?"

    yu "Thanks for the help."

    yu "Ah, good. It's good to see she's finally gotten herself a man."

    "…"

    "Still, I can't help but mull the idea over."

    yu "Yup!"

    "She grabs into her bag and one-by-one grabs the bottles from inside."

    "As she does, our jaws slowly drop open."

    "Some kind of white wine. The price tag, still stuck to the bottle, doesn't bode well for its quality."

    "Vodka. A brand so cheap even I know it's barely drinkable."

    "After unpacking a final bottle, a golden-brown rum, all Hanako and I can do is stare speechless at the small pile of alcohol on the floor between us."

    yu "Come on, it's your birthday, loosen up a bit~!"

    "Hanako and Lilly go distinctly silent, their stares aimed directly at her."

    yu "Hmm? Oh, yeah, I asked a couple of students for directions. Seems you're quite famous."

    hi "Famous?"

    "There are quite a few terms fit to describe me; “manly,” “brave” and “handsome” being amongst them."

    "…Well, maybe not, but I can't say “famous” comes to mind either."

    "Quietly walking over to Hanako and then Yuuko, I carefully lay the blankets over them making sure not to wake them up."

    "Though, the thick smell of alcohol coming off their breaths makes me doubtful they'd wake up no matter what I did."

    "I stand and take one last measure of the room."

    "Three girls, all pissed as newts, sleeping overnight in a male student's dorm. What a scandal that'd be if it broke out."

    "I suppose I'll grab Misha and Shizune tomorrow and apologise. While they may take pleasure in finding out even the most banal facts on every student in the school, they don't seem the type to tell tales for no reason."

    "I crouch down to get a better look."

    "Her porclain skin blends in with the white sheets of the bed, a look of slumber-born peacefulness on her face."

    "Now though, she seems painfully delicate."

    "The look she had when listening to the music box floats into my mind."

    "I thought it'd be a nice gift, but I'd hardly expected it to be so moving for her."

    "One birthday after another. Just she and Hanako."

    "Maybe it wasn't the music box she liked."
