    "He has written a rather easy equation on the blackboard and desperately tries to get the class to partake in the lesson."

    emi "Of eight, of course."

    hi "Oh, I thought there might have been fewer participant teams, for instance; two?"

    "Her face drops instantly to horrified anger when she realises I'm teasing her. I can almost see steam coming out of her bright red ears."

    emi "Whaaat? Hisao, you should not underestimate my powers!"

    "She wags her index finger at me in a scolding manner. I hold my hands up to appease her."

    hi "Sorry, sorry. Just kidding. Are you going to participate in other contests or did I miss my chance to see you in action completely?"

    emi "Nah, I'm going to run in the 100 meter dash later. Will you stay and watch?"

    hi "Sure. I'll be cheering for you."

    emi "Rin is somewhere there in the audience, you should try to find her so she won't be all alone."

    rin "Oh, hello, Hisao. You are here. Or there, but I guess you are close enough to be called here."

    "I point at the seat next to her."

    rin "I don't see anyone sitting there, do you?"

    hi "No."

    rin "Oh, that's good. You got me worried for a while. I don't see anyone either, so it must be free."

    "Sometimes, I wish I could converse with Rin in a manner that would not make me feel incredibly stupid."

    "I sit on the obviously vacant seat and lean back, trying and failing to find a comfortable position on the hard wooden bench."

    "We watch the boys run 400 metres and then 200 metres without trading another word."

    "The audience are cheering on them, waving their hands, whistling and yelling to their heart's content."

    "The runners are chasing each other around the track, each striving to beat the others."

    rin "Would anyone know if I did?"

    "Rin turns her head to look at me, resting her cheek on her kneecaps. Her eyes betray a hint of something unusual, but I couldn't say what."

    rin "When you saw something I had done, did you think of what feelings I had put into the painting, as you said? What did you think?"

    "I don't want to admit it to her, but yes, even now I usually marvel at her deftness at using her feet rather than her art in itself."

    "I don't even understand art really, so in the end it wouldn't be any use even if I tried to put some deeper interpretations to it, when I know I can't?"

    "The comparison is like a slap across the face. I would never have thought Rin at all self-conscious about her disability, not with the ease she manages everyday life."

    "I thought Rin was as nonchalant with her disability as she is with everything. Pretty presumptuous of me, now that I think about it."

    rin "There is art and there is not art. This is not art, it's just drawing. I don't like it that much."

    "Her distinction between the two doesn't make much sense to me. Then again, a lot of things she says don't."

    hi "{a=ismuth_R8_ART}What is art{/a} then?"

    rin "It's something that comes from inside of you, not from outside, like feelings."

    rin "Other people can't tell you how you feel. It's the same with this."

    hi "Okay, I got it. There is art and then there is everything that is not interesting."

    "Rin finishes with a nod as if to confirm my statement and glances at her blank sheet of paper."

    rin "I had a good idea a few days ago so I'm trying to remember what it was so I could draw that one."

    "I can't help but smile at Rin, the way her passion shines through her nonchalant appearance when it comes to art and the way she is capable of talking for surprisingly long without breathing in."

    "Shaking my head, I set back to work the details of the lush canopies of my half-finished cherry trees."

    "I can hear another pencil join mine, and glance at Rin, who true enough has finally started on her drawing as well."

    "Her eyes are again lost in thought, seeing nothing but the piece of paper in front of her and the picture in her mind."

    "Rin seems to be slowly drifting away, back to the mysterious inner world of hers, leaving me all alone to this real one."

    "For a while, the sound of two pencils scratching against two sheets of paper is the only disturbance in the stillness of our surroundings."

    "Even the time seems to become lazy, passing at a quiet and slow pace very similar to my snail-like progress with the drawing."

    "A sudden guffaw of laughter somewhere not too far away disrupts my concentration, causing me to look up to locate the culprit."

    "On the other side of the quadrangle Nomiya is talking animatedly with two girls from the club."

    "I see him waving his hand at them, and watch him strolling across the quadrangle to our direction so slowly that it's almost hypnotizing."

    "He gives a wave to us as well as he approaches, but I am probably the only one who notices him."

    no "Well! Aren't you two getting along well?"

    "The sound of his voice draws Rin back to reality, and she looks up from her drawing, looking somewhat annoyed at the sudden interruption."

    rin "We are just drawing at the same place, not entirely coincidentally though."

    no "Is that so? How are the drawings coming along then?"

    "He looks down to see our drawings and raises her eyebrows in surprise as he sees Rin's drawing which doesn't look like vegetation at all."

    no "That doesn't look like vegetation at all."

    rin "Pretty observant, sensei."

    rin "It is a cliff jumping off a person except that that cliffs can't jump, so they are just floating apart like two soap bubbles when someone blows between them just a little bit so that they won't pop."

    "Nomiya stays admirably unfazed in the face of the surprise flood of art babble Rin bursts into."

    no "Oh, was the assignment too boring?"

    rin "I'm sorry."

    "The flat tone Rin speaks with is directly at odds with the apologetic answer she gives to the teacher, who doesn't seem to mind in the least."

    no "Don't be, I'm happy if you have done at least something."

    "He takes another curious glance towards Rin's drawing, but her feet are in his way."

    no "Can I see it?"

    "Without saying anything Rin pushes her paper across the few feet separating her and Nomiya, who crouches to pick it up."

    "He lifts his tinted glasses on top of his head and scans over the drawing, keeping it at an arm's length and even stretching his neck backwards to add to the distance. It looks strange."

    "Apparently happy with what he is seeing, he glances over the drawing at Rin, smiling genially and raising his eyebrows."

    no "A sketch for a painting?"

    "Rin gives the slightest of nods, obviously knowing that the question was merely rhetorical, only reassuring herself even when it's not necessary."

    no "I think it looks good, you should go for it if you feel like painting it."

    rin "I think I could do it one of these days. Maybe if it's properly cloudy some day."

    no "How about you then, Nakai?"

    "He turns to my direction like a vulture preying on a dehydrating victim."

    "I show him my rough drawing, and he looks over it enthusiastically."

    no "Hmm hmm. You could try to take a look at the perspective. The proportions seem to be slightly off here and here."

    "He points at several spots on the drawing, but unfortunately I can't see which places he is pointing at because he is holding it away from me."

    no "Also try to pay a bit more attention to the shading, it's a very important aspect of graphite drawing, after all. It seems a bit sloppy, perhaps?"

    hi "I'll do my best."

    "He returns my paper to me and turns back to Rin, who already has lapsed back into fixatedly observing the way the grass blades sway gently in the light breeze sweeping over the quadrangle."

    "She even sways back and forth in the same rhythm herself."

    no "Listen Rin, have you given any thought to that matter we talked about last week?"

    rin "A little."

    "Despite her nonchalant tone, Nomiya's lips curve into a smile."

    no "And what do you think?"

    rin "I don't know. I don't like it."

    "Rin being bothered clearly bothers Nomiya. He furrows his brow smacks his lips unappreciatively."

    no "Please reconsider it, I think it's a unique and wonderful chance for you and you really should take up on it."

    "Rin wiggles her head to and fro in a way that could be interpreted either as a denial or agreement, or both."

    "I don't have time to pipe up and inquire what the two are talking about, as Nomiya checks his watch and draws in a sharp breath."

    no "Heavens, look at the time. Come on you two, we must hurry back to the classroom."

    "Rin tilts her head at my indecisiveness, as if she doesn't understand what I'm trying not to say."

    rin "Oh, what will you be studying?"

    hi "Ehh…haven't decided."

    rin "So you don't know anything about your future."

    "Even though she is right, the blunt tone of hers makes my blood boil."

    hi "How can anyone know about their future? "
    
    hi "That's stupid, sure you can have whatever grandiose plans for it, but in the end you might get screwed over by something completely unexpected."

    hi "I for one certainly didn't plan to have a heart attack at the ripe age of 17…"

    hi "…nor did I plan to be forced to come to this school hundreds of miles away from my home after spending the better part of half a year in hospital…"
    
    hi "…nor did I plan to come to this club and attempt and fail painting this stupid painting."

    rin "Did I make you angry?"

    hi "No. I just… never mind. What I tried to say is that, you can hope things from future but you can't know a thing."

    rin "And now you said it."

    hi "Yeah. Besides, you too—" #reminder for the potential {nw} break

    rin "A butterfly."

    "Rin interrupts me, although it looks like it is not intentional as she has already moved her restless attention to the sky shining through the windows of the classroom."

    hi "A what?"

    rin "It would be nice to be a butterfly. In the future."

    "Her voice is dreamy, making me uncertain if she is conscious of the fact that she is talking with me."

    rin "There is a thing I want to do, but…"

    "Her voice trails off to a whisper, causing the last few words become too quiet to hear. I get the feeling that she didn't want me to hear them, but I can't help asking."

    hi "But what?"

    "Rin turns to look at me, her mouth drawn in a perfectly horizontal line."

    rin "I can't. So I thought I'd learn how to."

    hi "So, what, you are not a butterfly just yet?"

    rin "I am me."

    "The simple statement seems to carry much more weight than what it's worth with the way Rin says it, a firm utterance without an ounce of hesitation."

    "Rin too seems to be impressed by it. She pauses, then whispers the sentence a few times to herself as if she, by saying it aloud, discovered that she in fact is herself."

    rin "Nomiya has been trying to help me, sorta like a teacher or something."

    "So the thing she wants to do was painting after all? It would make sense, as it is the only thing I've seen Rin pay more than passing attention."

    hi "He is a teacher."

    rin "Yeah, but not a teacher like that. A nice kind of teacher."

    hi "So he like, what, helps you with your art?"

    rin "He points out things he thinks I should not do and he points out things he thinks I should do better. He also points out things he thinks I am doing well."

    hi "I guess that's helping."

    "Speaking of the devil, Nomiya enters the classroom with barely fifteen minutes left until the end of the club."

    no "Hello, everyone! How have you been doing?"

    "His entry makes other people notice that the meeting is at the end too. Everyone starts putting down their materials and get ready to leave."

    "The club members are pretty disciplined, as most of them at least try to keep some order instead of just throwing everything onto Nomiya's desk."

    "Still, since we didn't have any control with the materials we used, the amount of stuff piling on the two wooden trays on the desk is pretty huge."

    "The teacher doesn't look too happy about it either."

    no "Nakai, would you stay to help me cleaning?"

    "Me? I reflexively turn my head when I hear my name being called. The other members are quickly clearing out of the classroom, obviously knowing that staying behind means extra work."

    "I don't have the option to decline, it seems."

    "Of the few people still left, nobody volunteers to help with the cleaning and even Rin exits, leaving us two between ourselves to clean up."

    "As I gather the materials back to their respective boxes to be taken to the storage, I notice Nomiya studying me intently."

    no "I've noticed you get along well with Tezuka."

    hi "I guess you could say that."

    no "I'm surprised, really, and happy. She's always been a bit antisocial so it's a good thing if she found a friend."

    no "You know Nakai, it makes me wonder if you could help me…"

    no "You see, I happen to be in very good standing within the art community in this town. Some of them are very famous people, you know, like the person I was meeting today."

    no "At any rate, I am certain that Tezuka has the potential to become something."

    "I fetch the last brushes that someone had forgot to the desks at the back, and then we are ready to take all of them to the arts storage."

    no "I can see it in her art, she definitely has the talent."

    no "So I have been talking about her to a gallerist friend of mine, so that she would have some of Tezuka's works on display."

    no "Unfortunately, Tezuka herself has been pretty hardheaded about it, saying that she doesn't want to put her works on show."

    no "I've tried to reason with her, but as you probably know, it's quite hard."

    "The hallway is empty save for us. The wooden tray is too big to be carried comfortably now that it's loaded with all sorts of brushes and other utensils, but I carry my burden without complaining."

    "Nomiya, with the smaller of the two trays on his arms, keeps on babbling about Rin."

    no "So, I wonder if you could talk with Tezuka about it, and try to make her change her mind."

    no "It would be most unfortunate if she misses this chance."

    no "Don't you agree?"

    "It takes me a second to realize that he had stopped talking."

    hi "Ah, Yes."

    "It is strange…"

    no "Right, I'll trust you to try your best. Thank you very much for helping me with these. Off you go, then."

    "I leave Nomiya to sort the various materials to their proper places and make my way downstairs."

    "So Rin would, at least in theory, have a chance to get some of her paintings to a gallery? But she didn't sound too exhilarated about it."

    "Why would she be hesitant to take up on such an awesome offer, especially if she wants to become a professional artist?"

    "And why does Nomiya think I can help him and Rin?"

    "I have to admit, my interest is piqued, as this is gives me a chance to actually learn something about the enigma that Rin seems to be."

    "I don't really know what this game has to do with logic though… it feels more like intuition or mindreading."

    emi "Ok, let's start over. You can go first, Hisao."

    "I think for a moment for a thing that could symbolize another thing. It's not too easy to think of a good one, but for once I feel like it's better to not overanalyze."

    emi "No no, it was really good one. Let's continue, me next!"

    "She looks like she tries to think of her question very hard, even a bit too hard. I almost made the same mistake."

    rin "A fish."

    "Again with the fish? Emi doesn't look very pleased at herself."

    "She quickly brushes some dust into a shape of very elongated star and two very disfigured hearts with her toes, admittedly they are slightly resembling fishes."

    "Yeah, this game doesn't have anything to do with logic."

    "She halts on her tracks, causing me and Emi to walk a few steps before noticing that she is not with us anymore."

    "As we backtrack, I take a look at what Rin is watching so intently."

    "The shopkeeper pays us no attention as he lazily does some paperwork on the dark wooden counter in the back."

    "I idly browse the selection of watercolor supplies as I wait for Rin to watch around until she is satisfied."

    "Buying my own art supplies seems unnecessary even though I joined the club. It's just that I probably wouldn't do much of it on my free time."

    "Still, the fine brushes and fresh blocks of color look very fancy even to my eye."

    "Rin wanders through the aisles like a sleepwalker, periodically stopping to inspect some item, but not showing any interest in actually buying anything."

    "The precious few meters that separate the rooftop from the third floor below must be instrumental to the effect." 
    
    "The chain link fence allows for a grand view over the treetops, all the way to the grey silhouettes of the downtown further away."

    "The silvery blue sky seems to be a mere arm's reach away."

    "The rooftop might not be the top of the world, but for a small scale thing like my lunch break it's more than enough."

    "Only the sounds of the lunch break echoing from the cafeteria remind me of being in the school."

    "Maybe I really am six meters closer to heaven here."

    "Rin, too, is enjoying the closeness of the sky, lying on the rooftop not far from the bell tower."

    "She is watching the sky, or the clouds lazily drifting above, or both. Or sleeping."

    "I walk to take a look at her."

    "Two large, dark green eyes flicker about from below her short bangs. She must be awake. They move slowly to glare at me, proof of Rin acknowledging me."

    hi "Hi."

    "I know better than to wait for a response, and Rin doesn't seem to be in the mood to offer one either."

    hi "Where's Emi?"

    "The question is warranted, as the person who promised me delicious lunch is mysteriously missing."

    rin "In her room."

    hi "Did she have something else to do?"

    rin "She is sick. I think it's more or less a fever."

    rin "At least she said she wants to die and will not go to class and that I must get her cold medication and tea."

    "Rin's eyes harden for a moment, and her lips move quickly, whispering a repeat of her last line as if to confirm to herself that she really did say that."

    rin "Hmm, I seem to have forgot the medication. And the tea. I hope she is not very angry."

    hi "Oh, that's pretty unlucky. It's usually so rare to get the flu in the summer."

    rin "It's probably her body telling her to slow down."

    hi "I thought you said she just had the common cold."

    "She pauses for a while, maybe trying to rethink her nonsensical speculation."

    rin "It could be."

    rin "Things just are not always what they look like. Sometimes they are something completely else. I've seen it happen a few times."

    rin "This could be one of those cases again."

    hi "Why do you say that?"

    "Rin sits upright, crossing her legs and stretching her neck before answering."

    rin "Emi tries very hard."

    rin "Sometimes she tries too hard and overdoes things. I don't think it can be a good thing."

    "Rin's tone is abnormally clear and void of her usual slight drawl. Explaining things is not her forte, so I guess she compensates by concentrating harder."

    rin "After we came back yesterday, she went running to the track."

    hi "In the rain?"

    rin "In the rain."

    "That sounds a like going a bit too far with keeping up with training regime to me. Emi is a hardheaded one though, so I can see her running in the downpour just because she “had to.”"

    hi "Well, that's obviously overdoing it. And also the probable reason for her cold."

    hi "But isn't it a good thing that she has something she loves to do?"

    hi "Generally speaking, of course."

    "Rin shrugs, obviously not convinced."

    rin "But what about everything else?"

    hi "What else?"

    rin "Everything that is not running."

    rin "What if she never reads the book she would love the most? What if she never comes up with another hobby she would like? What if she never finds romance?"

    "Her concern is understandable, looking at how Emi got herself ill after getting drenched in the rain just because she wanted to go running, but still…"

    hi "I don't understand why you are so worried about a thing like that. Aren't you too painting all the time?"

    rin "It's all right. If I don't find romance I can always make a living out of my loneliness with paintings."

    rin "People who write books do it all the time."

    "Her answer surprises me. She sounds like… I don't know… Kenji, or even worse…"

    hi "That sounds a bit cynical. Are you sure you are not learning from me?"

    rin "I hope not."

    "Her sincere answer makes me laugh."

    hi "So, I take it we don't have lunch now?"

    "Rin shakes her head to confirm my suspicion."

    rin "Are you hungry?"

    hi "Not really."

    rin "We don't have lunch unless we go to cafeteria."

    "I am hungry, but not enough to make the trip downstairs and having to suffer the terrible cafeteria food."

    hi "It's fine with me. I'll fast."

    "What does one do on a lunch break if not eat?"

    "It turns out, between the two of us, that we don't know."

    "Neither seems to want to lie down and look at the clouds like we have done before, not even Rin, even though she seems to enjoy the superficially meaningless way to pass time."

    "It turns out that we are not needed. Time passes still, even though there is no conversation to fill the silence between ticks of the clock, no stupid activities like cloud-gazing to spend the minutes between now and next."

    "I wonder why, more often than not, we don't speak much at all."

    "Maybe it's because it's always so difficult to come up with something to talk with Rin. She and I are on such different wavelengths that nothing seems to be on a common ground."

    "Maybe it's because—" #reminder for the potential {nw} break

    rin "You came here anyway."

    "The interjection at my though process comes at a bad time, I was so engrossed with my contemplations about us not talking, that Rin suddenly talking catches me totally off guard."

    hi "Excuse me?"

    rin "You came here anyway, even though you are not hungry."

    "Her point, if there is one, eludes me. Why would I have stood up her, hypothetical Emi and — sadly — even more hypothetical lunch even if I wasn't starving?"

    hi "Well, you came here as well. And you knew that there wouldn't be food."

    rin "Lunch break is not only for food."

    hi "Now you answered your own question."

    "My clever reversal obviously impresses her, as a hint of a smile appears in the corners of her mouth."

    rin "I really did."

    "There is no more time to contemplate what lunch break actually is for, as the bells burst out into the melody signaling the end of lunch."

    "They're too noisy for comfort here on the roof, but certainly loud enough to be heard even at the dorms."

    hi "Damn, already? Better to go."

    "I stand up reluctantly, but knowing that tardiness leads to scolding if I am late for the social studies class."

    hi "See you in the club after classes."

    hi "Hey, do you think we are closer to the heaven up here?"

    "Rin turns to estimate the heavens, maybe on reflex, maybe to make the figure of speech into something more tangible to her."

    rin "I know a better place."

    "Maybe an esoteric thing like this can be tangible to someone like Rin."

    hi "You do? Well, show it to me sometime."

    "The hallway slowly empties of people after the last classes of the day are over, but don't feel like going into the arts classroom just yet."

    "I am left alone."

    "I am a bit too tall for the old desks at the classrooms so my legs tend to get sore after sitting all day. Better to flex my muscles before I have to sit down again."

    "Besides, I don't even have anything to do in the classroom since I don't know the other people."

    "It's funny, despite Rin saying that I would probably like the other club members, I ended up sticking with her through almost all the club meetings."

    "At first it was maybe because she, like me, was always alone while everyone else was not, but it soon became apparent that she doesn't mind being alone."

    "I lean against the wall, scratching my tickling ear. As much as I'd like to think that it's only my inner masochist raising its ugly head, the truth is that Rin has grown on me, even if it's just a little."

    "It's not that her strangeness is any less strange, I just am more accustomed to it."

    "Despite her uncanny ability at frustrating me, I like being with Rin."

    "Nomiya appears from the stairwell, walking this way very briskly. It must be time for the club meeting."

    no "Good afternoon, Nakai."

    hi "Good afternoon, sensei."

    "I note that he has learned my name only now, although I think he has used it before too."

    "Well, that makes more sense as Nomiya seems to have way less students to take care of than most other teachers."

    no "How are you today?"

    hi "I'm fine thanks."

    "He smiles, seeming happy at my well-being, despite my answer being just the automated one, an empty thing you say when someone asks you how you are doing." #wellbeing -> well-being

    no "Good, good. So, did you talk with Tezuka about the thing I mentioned last time?"

    "Oh. I had forgotten it totally since I didn't see Rin until yesterday, and then, well, I had forgotten it."

    hi "Sorry, sensei, I haven't. I forgot it completely."

    "Nomiya doesn't look too pleased at my confession. His frown makes me uncomfortably conscious of the fact that I let him down."

    no "That's not good. Maybe I didn't stress enough how important this is potentially to Tezuka. Surely you'd like to support her as well. You are friends, right?"

    "Friends? I don't know… at least I haven't thought of it like that."
    #
    "It's more like me and Rin just tend to hang around each other irregularly, talking, or not, about something that more often resembles some crazy twisted mutation of philosophy rather than normal, everyday things that friends talk about."

    "I don't know how to respond, but to my relief I don't have to as Nomiya pushes his frustration away and attempts to smile reassuringly."

    no "Oh well, no matter. But please, do try to persuade her if you can, as I am at my wit's end I'm afraid."

    "I manage to nod at him, making a mental note that I really bring it up with Rin."

    no "Enough of that, we are almost late."

    "Nomiya conjures a brilliant smile on his lips just before he enters the classroom while I sneak to my usual seat with considerably less ado."

    no "Good afternoon everyone! I hope everyone is well?"

    "The club members mumble their hellos and sit down, waiting for the teacher to continue."

    no "So, as I unfortunately had to leave you last Thursday, I'd like to have a look at what you did and then we could continue to improve on those works, if possible."

    "Everyone shuffles to get their materials and works from the last time, creating a hustle."

    "I have to fetch Rin's oil painting in addition to my own stuff. It's heavy and cumbersome, but I get it to our seats unscathed."

    "I am not really in the mood to continue the watercolor painting from last time, but I can't think of any other thing to do right now so I sit down on my seat to work on it."

    "I get the feeling that I am missing something about how this is supposed to be done, as nothing I do seems to make it look like what I intended."

    "The difficulties I have with the painting make it hard to concentrate, and I soon find my thoughts wander off…"

    no "So Nakai, let me see that…"

    "Nomiya has sneaked behind me, and now is leaning down to look at my water colors."

    "He hmms and umms a few times before speaking again."

    no "I think that you should…"

    "I let his critique pass from one ear to another, nodding absentmindedly at the correct places."

    "He has good advice about something I should try to make the colours more vibrant, but I don't want to ask him to repeat what he just said as it would be the same as admitting I didn't listen to a word of it."

    "As I watch him pass Rin with only an approving nod before walking to the next victim, Nomiya's request pops to my mind, making me forget about daydreaming."

    "I glance at the red-haired girl sitting on the floor not three feet away from me."

    "Rin has her silver-coloured earphones on again, isolating her into a private world of music and painting."

    "She paints in big sweeps over the canvas, her toes almost, but not quite brushing against the wet paint."

    "How am I supposed to talk with her about anything like this?"

    #reminder for possible choice to not take her earphones off.

    "There is only one course of action."

    "I grab the earphones and yank them off her head."

    "This gets instant attention from Rin, as she turns around to look at me, her eyes wide with surprise."

    rin "Give those back."

    hi "Hey, I have a question."

    rin "I don't want to answer it. Give those back."

    "Her first sentence gives me a pause, and a question that has been bothering me ever since the first club meeting I attended escapes my lips instead of the one I planned to ask."

    hi "You know, I've been wondering why do you never socialize with the other people here."
    
    hi "I don't think I've seen you speak as much as a single sentence to anyone except me or the teacher."

    "Rin stares at the earphones dangling a feet above her head. I realize I'm being pretty rude, but tough cases call for tough measures."

    rin "They do not interest me. Give those back, I have to paint now."

    "She is still looking at the earphones, even though taking them off was meant to make her pay attention to me. Well, at least she is talking."

    hi "You don't like them?"

    rin "It's not that."

    "The look on Rin's eyes tells that she knows that is not a sufficient answer. She looks like she is actually in pain as she tries to think how to explain what she means."

    rin "We wouldn't have anything to talk about. Please give those back before I lose this thing inside me that is really good."
    
    rin "It could be good enough to last me to the end of this painting."

    "Does she need the headphones to prevent thoughts from escaping her brain through the ears?"

    "At least Rin is looking at them very yearningly, obviously wanting them back so she can return to her seclusion on the floor."

    "I won't let her."

    rin "Give those back or I won't forgive you. Don't you understand? I have to paint."

    "Something about the subtle shift of her usually so monotone voice makes me realize she really means it."

    "Besides, I feel pretty bad about forcing her to talk like this. I guess it's no use, Rin talks only if she will."

    hi "Okay, okay. I understand."

    hi "Sorry."

    "I crouch down and set the earphones on her ears, sweeping the auburn hair covering her ears away so it won't be in the way."

    "I can feel the tension draining from Rin, almost like every muscle in her body relaxed at the same time"

    "Rin closes her eyes, letting the music flow in her ears. A deep breath out, and then she opens them again but doesn't look at me anymore."

    rin "Just wait a little."

    "For what? Rin just picks up her brush and returns to work."

    "Another black line is drawn over the canvas."

    "I wait a little while, watching over Rin's shoulder at her work. The little while stretches first to a long while, then to a really long while."

    "She paints, her entire being fully concentrated on the brush between her slender toes and the painting coming to life one sweep of a brush at a time."

    "I don't really understand how Rin takes some idea she has and then is capable of translating it to an abstract painting like that."

    "At first glance it looks like a mess of colours and shapes, impossible to interpret as anything, but the longer I stare at it, the better it looks to me."

    "It's still not making sense, but somehow, it's not a mess either."

    "Is this the difference between “art” and “not art?”"

    "I glance at my painting, but it doesn't really beckon me to work further. Failure is a failure and there is nothing I can do anymore to salvage it."

    "So, I content myself with watching Rin's feet move."

    rin "I don't like talking."

    "The single-sentence contradiction strikes as strange to the pedantic part of my brain, but the breaking of silence interests me much more than pointing out the fact."

    "Besides, as Rin is still listening to the music from her earphones, she probably wouldn't hear me either."

    rin "Words are not the thing you want to say. It's something else you want to say, but you have to say words."

    rin "I… know that some people think my words don't really make sense."
    
    extend "I am not stupid, you know."

    "She turns to me, confirming that she actually addressed her words to me instead of the just talking to the air."

    rin "So I try to not to."

    hi "But you talk to me, don't you?"

    "Rin looks at me, frowning like one frowns to a child who asks stupid questions. Her eyes look very sad."

    rin "I thought you'd have a chance to understand."

    rin "I think I would prefer if…"

    "She draws in deep breath, interrupting the sentence in the middle of the word."

    rin "A."

    "A?"

    rin "Aaa…"

    rin "Atchoo!"

    "The sneeze is so loud that everyone else in the room turns to look at Rin, probably trying to determine if that was a hand grenade explosion or what. Luckily Rin had enough sense to not aim at me or the painting."

    hi "Bless you. Are you sick now as well?"

    hi "Anyway, you were saying…"

    no "All right everyone, time to start cleaning up!"

    "Nomiya chooses this very moment to interrupt, stealing Rin's attention over continuing the discussion."

    "Everyone stops whatever they are doing and diligently begin to clean up the classroom."

    "Sighing, I too start to collect my stuff and turn in my painting. Nomiya tries very hard to conceal his disdain, but there is nothing he could say that I already don't know."

    "When I lift my bag off the floor, Rin has already disappeared with only the large painting propped up against the wall reminding that she was here."

    "Damn, it wasn't even two days ago that Rin was complaining how Emi always overdoes things. Pot, kettle and so on, I guess."

    emi "Anyway, you shouldn't have taken them off. That's not what friends do to friends."

    "I don't fail to notice that Emi herself also ruined Rin's inspiration that time, but maybe it doesn't count if the option is to let her physically harm herself?"

    hi "Is Rin angry with me then?"

    "I clear my throat pretty unnaturally behind a girl who is standing at the intersection of the first corridor, maybe waiting for a friend or something."

    "She doesn't reckon me though I thought I'd have made my presence clear."

    hi "Excuse me."

    "As she still won't pay attention to me, I walk around to her front, which finally rouses the girl."

    "She looks up to me and raises her eyebrows silently."

    hi "'Scuse me, but would you happen to know where Rin Tezuka's room is?"

    "The girl quickly shakes her head and makes two fast gestures with her hands."

    "Oh dear."

    "She is deaf."

    "I try to sign an apology without knowing what the correct sign even is, repeating “Sorry” and hoping she can read lips. I feel the blood surging to my cheeks."

    "She smiles amusedly at my despair and fishes a small notebook, not entirely unlike the one Shizune uses to communicate with us linguistically challenged, and offers it to me."

    "I accept it thankfully and quickly scribble my question on the paper. She answers just as quickly."

    $ written_note("I think I know who you are talking about, but I am not exactly sure. Tezuka is that redheaded amputee from 3-4, or am I thinking of someone else?")

    "I nod at her in relief and she quickly adds one more sentence."

    $ written_note("I think I know who you are talking about, but I am not exactly sure. Tezuka is that redheaded amputee from 3-4, or am I thinking of someone else?\n\nIt should be the third corridor down the hallway.")

    "I quickly bow thanks and scurry away before embarrassing myself any more. At least this person was nicer and more understanding than Shizune."

    "There are five doors in the third corridor, all of them looking exactly like each other."

    "If the layout is the same as in my dorm, the first door is the bathroom and the others are normal rooms."

    "One of the doors has a nameplate with “Ibarazaki” and two others belong to people I don't know, Kashiwagami and Yoshida."

    "The unmarked door is hopefully what I am looking for."

    "What am I doing?"

    "Rin's door looks the same as mine, just a simple wooden door."

    "Maybe a tad more intimidating."

    "I ball my hand into a fist and hesitantly raise it to knock on the white-painted door."

    "My knuckles rap against the door three times in quick succession. The sudden sound against the silence of the corridor makes me flinch."

    "I wait a bit, glancing down the hallway to see if anyone heard the ungodly loud noise I made."

    "A moment passes, then another, but the door doesn't open."

    hi "Rin?"

    "No answer from the other side."

    hi "It's me, Hisao. Are you there?"

    "Still no answer."

    "Maybe she is asleep, or not there."

    "Hard to say where she could have gone, though, if she is supposed to be sick."

    "I wait for a little longer, feeling increasingly stupid trying to stare the door open, but to no avail."

    "Maybe I'll come back tomorrow."

    "Maybe she was sleeping."

    "The open doorway seems to be more of an obstacle than the closed door was, but as Rin doesn't say anything else, I step through it into her room."

    "Rin is leaning against the wall on her bed, leaving the only chair in the room for me."

    "She keeps her quiet even after I sit down so maybe she meant to invite me in but just forgot to actually say it aloud?"

    "The room is very normal, which strikes me as strange."

    "I expected something more… different."

    "There are some paintings, undoubtedly Rin's, hanging on the walls but that's about the only real difference between her room and mine."

    rin "Nobody has visited me before."

    "The breaking silence draws my attention from the room to its inhabitant, who currently seems to be in the middle of a very profound thought process."

    rin "Actually that was not true, but Emi doesn't count."

    rin "Can't put my bra or pants on otherwise."

    "She looks groggily down at her legs which are only halfway covered by the bedsheets."

    rin "Which is probably why I have neither on, now that I think about it."

    "I haven't failed to notice that Rin doesn't have her shirt buttoned up either, and trying to remind myself where her eyes are is becoming increasingly hard."

    "She pauses for a while and glances up at my dumbfounded face."

    rin "On second thought, you probably can."

    hi "Well yes, that's the usual time to wake up if you want to go to the morning classes."

    "I'm trying to sound as reasonable as possible to counteract Rin's unreasonable annoyance."

    rin "Told her to sod off."

    rin "She gave me some medicine and told me to take them."

    "I follow her eyes to her night table upon which a suspiciously empty metal foil sheet of medication lies."

    "I pick it up and turn it around see what kind of medication Emi brought."

    "Active ingredient… Codeine?"

    hi "You took all of these?" #ate -> took 

    rin "She told me to take them. I was hurting really bad in the morning, but now I think I don't hurt anymore."

    rin "Actually… I think I'm feeling juuuust fine."

    "Her head lolls around a round, looking like she is trying to stretch her neck muscles or pass out."

    "A full sheet of this stuff? Can that be safe anymore? At least it's bound to have some side effects… which I'm afraid I am witnessing right now."

    rin "I am feeling just fine… I am fine…fine… just someone take this buzzing away from my head."

    rin "It's like many of those insect things… or one really big insect thing."

    rin "With lots of wings. Very much colour and everything."

    rin "And shapes. I like shapes."

    "She smiles slightly at the last observation. The small pause in her monologue is not enough for me to dare saying something that potentially but not likely could salvage this discussion."

    rin "I saw some nice shapes yesterday."

    rin "What did you see yesterday?"

    rin "Hisao."

    "She utters my name as an afterthought, possibly to make clear that she is now addressing me instead of just talking her mind to whoever might be listening."

    hi "I actually came by yesterday as well. I knocked on the door, but you were not here or something."

    "Rin raises her eyebrows, making them almost disappear under her short bangs."

    rin "Just come in."

    hi "What?"

    rin "There is no lock on the door."

    hi "What?"

    rin "There is a lock on the door."

    rin "It is not locked, but it exists."

    rin "On the door."

    rin "I have only one key, but two people must come in."

    rin "Emi comes in sometimes."

    rin "As I already said."

    rin "You must pay more attention to what I say."

    rin "Otherwise I repeat myself."

    "The sentences come out of her mouth, and probably her brain, one at a time with a small pause between each, making her gibberish hard to understand."

    "I nod in understanding thought, despite not being entirely sure where she got the impression that I didn't know that Emi visits Rin occasionally."

    rin "And that is no good because then I can't think of any new thoughts."

    "Rin finishes with one more line, getting to say the last word over herself, an impressive display of what I can only describe as mental shadowboxing."

    "The odd situation has left me speechless since about the time Rin opened her mouth for the first time, and now that she herself doesn't seem to have anything more to add, silence takes over the small room."

    "It makes me glance around Rin's room in an attempt to find something to talk about."

    "The room is about as small as mine is. The big window, which takes the wall furthest from the door, gives to east just like mine."

    "About a dozen paintings, most in Rin's signature abstract style are taking up the rest of the wall space."

    "A faint smell of art… of paint and paper is floating in the air despite Rin saying that she doesn't like painting in her room."

    "Maybe she does anyway, sometimes."

    "Rin is not very concerned about tidiness it seems, as everything she owns seems to be arranged in various piles around her room."

    hi "Your room looks nice."

    "It's an empty sentence one uses to fill empty spaces in conversations, but my wits are failing me pretty hard right now."

    rin "Yeah. Would you like me to show you the places?"

    "She looks down at her half-open shirt quizzically, making me inadvertently follow her gaze to her chest."

    rin "Oh… I guess I already did."

    "I can't deny that, no matter how hard I tried to act properly."

    "I want to watch, but I don't want to."

    "I am not supposed to."

    "These are the conflicts in a man's life. How wretched."

    "It is best to not take advantage of Rin's careless state though."

    "I will not watch. At least not too much."

    rin "It is very nice that you came to see me."

    rin "It makes me feel very… what's that word… you know, the one about things and stuff."

    rin "Anyway, you came."

    "Rin's blabbering makes me remember that I actually came here for a reason, although it was half prompted by Emi."

    hi "Hey, about the club meeting on Monday."

    rin "Hmmm?"

    "Rin doesn't seem to be exactly attentive right now, but it's not like she ever is."

    "I continue to just get it off my chest."

    hi "Sorry about almost ruining your painting."

    "Rin tilts her head and furrows her brows, looking like she doesn't get what I'm talking about."

    rin "I don't get what you are talking about."

    rin "It's ok."

    rin "I am feeling all right about it."

    rin "It's just sometimes a bit hard to keep my thoughts the way I like them."

    rin "They are not very straight, at least most of the time."

    rin "Not that I want to have them straight… I just wish they were at least in some shape."

    rin "Round is fine too."

    rin "My thoughts are very messy."

    rin "Messy."

    "She repeats the word melancholically, then flops lying down on her bed and nuzzles her head against her pillow, shutting her eyes."

    rin "Enough. Tired."

    "She opens one of her eyes to look at me."

    rin "Was it you who likes to look at sleeping girls? Or someone else?"

    rin "Maybe there were many of those."

    rin "I can't remember."

    rin "You can stay if you want."

    hi "Nono, I'll leave. I have to… do homework anyway."

    "I stand up from the chair and take a step towards the door."

    rin "Wait."

    "Her request stops me on my tracks, not that I intended to scoot off right away."

    "I look over my shoulder at the girl lying on her bed, again with the strangest kind of smile on her features."

    "She should smile more often."

    rin "I can walk you to the door."

    rin "It's the least a gentleman can do."

    "Her remark makes me smile as well. The distance to the door is maybe three feet and I already am at an arm's length from the handle."

    "Rin herself giggles, making me certain beyond absoluteness that her cold medication dosage was way too heavy today."

    rin "I have always wanted to say that."

    "Difficultly and slowly, Rin rises first to sit again, then she stands up even more difficultly and slowly."

    "Indecency draws my eyes instantly to the curve of her thighs and the striped panties, from where my manners force me to lift my gaze back to Rin's eye level."

    "Rin is standing, although barely. It looks like she has trouble keeping her balance for some reason, probably the side effect of the medicine."

    "She takes an unsteady step towards me, then another smaller one as she notices that it's not a good idea to try to take big steps."

    rin "I guess I was confused yesterday and then I was confused today too, like a flu or being tired or other things that won't go away if you sleep."

    "Rin raises her chin to look up at me again."

    rin "You are… my friend, right?"

    "Rin… thinks of me as a friend?"

    "If nobody else comes here, does that make the hilltop, in a way, a secret place?"

    "I guess I read too deep into the word choice, and got my expectations a bit too high."

    rin "It's like in the pictures."

    "The irony gives me a wheezing laughing fit that dies instantly as my diaphragm starts to cramp again."

    "We trudged to the top somehow, panting and sweating… to see the view just like it is in the pictures."

    "It's not just us; everyone who visits anything worth visiting has the same dilemma."

    "They bother themselves a lot to see places they could see from pictures or even worse, they take photos so that they can see what they saw after they return home."

    "I feel my pulse go down and my breathing becomes more even, allowing me to breathe in deeply and stretch to my full height."

    "The wind picks up, swaying the canopies below us and ruffling my hair. It makes the grass sway in waves as the breeze sweeps across the hilltop."

    "Sun shines from the open skies on us, what just moments before was painful heat is now gentle warmth."

    "I'm pretty sure that all that bother was worth it."

    "Rin did not lie; this place must be as close to heaven as it's possible around here."

    "As I take another deep breath, a familiar scent that I can't name right now makes me look around in search of the source."

    "It's flowers."

    "The entire hilltop is covered with yellow flowers."

    "Dandelions."

    "It's like the places where there is no tall grass had been painted brilliant yellow."

    "Rin notices me marveling the yellow sea and sits down on the grass, making me follow the suit to rest my aching feet."

    rin "They grow here every year, and when the summer is over they fly away."

    "Her voice is melancholic and surprisingly emotional, a strange contrast to her usual monotony."

    hi "Does it make you feel sad for them?"

    "She looks around the flowers surrounding her as if to find out what she thinks about them."

    rin "No."

    rin "That is what they must do, otherwise they wouldn't be proper flowers."

    "Her words give me a pause, reminding me of her talk at the track meet."

    hi "Then, does it make you feel sad for yourself?"

    "She doesn't answer, but with Rin it's not possible to say if I hit a nerve or if she ignored the question out of a whim."

    "It makes me remember Nomiya's proposal."

    hi "Why don't you want to take up on the change to get your paintings to a gallery?"

    hi "The teacher told me that he tried to set up something with some friend of his, and that you didn't think it was a good idea."

    rin "I don't think it is a good idea."

    "Rin voice is bored and irritated at the same time. This really seems to be a bad topic."

    hi "But you want to be a proper artist, right?"

    rin "Maybe. Probably."

    hi "You can't really do that if nobody knows of you, or buys your works."

    "I look around me to come up with something else to say."

    hi "Wouldn't it be sad if these flowers would not fly away?"

    "She just shrugs her shoulders dismissively."

    rin "I want people to see the paintings, but I want them to look only at the paintings."

    rin "If I could be invisible there would be no problem."

    rin "Do you know how to be invisible?"

    hi "Wait, what? Let's backtrack a bit. I didn't think you were a shy person."

    "Rin looks very sour at this discussion, but I promised the teacher that I'd try to talk to her."

    "I can't really back up."

    rin "I have told it to you before."

    rin "If someone looks at my paintings, he doesn't look at my paintings. He looks at me."

    rin "I think that is not good."

    rin "Don't you understand?"

    hi "I do understand, but… how bad can it really be? You can't seriously expect that people would be gawking at you like a talking dog or something."

    "Then again, it's not like I can expect people to ignore Rin's… special circumstances either."

    "It's not like I did, or do."

    hi "Yeah, I get that you place a lot more worth on the art itself than the fact that you painted it, but isn't it equally bad thing to not even try to see what happens?"

    hi "You know, when I told you that I decided to live my life a little better, you said that you thought it was a good thing."

    hi "I don't understand why you refuse so adamantly to seize chances in your own life."

    hi "It would be a waste, and it makes no sense."

    "Rin takes my speech without blinking an eye, her mouth tightly shut."

    "I wonder if I made her angry."

    "As she doesn't say anything even after I finish, I feel compelled to add a final note."
    
    hi "You should do it."

    "Rin flops lying down on the grass and flowers, turning her eyes up to the distant blue above us."

    "I take it as a sign that the discussion is over now."

    "It bothers me."

    "She bothers me."

    "Whenever I think that I might have some idea what Rin is thinking, I find out that I have no idea at all about what she is thinking."

    "She is so odd. That's why we can never understand each other."

    "I'm feeling a little bad about making her upset so, and only because I was asked to."

    "But I spoke my own words, not Nomiya's so I can't really blame him either, and it was me who agreed to do it in the first place."
