    mu "On the one hand, there was chemistry, 'cause of all the explosions."

    "Muto trails off, and frowns slightly."

    mu "Still, I suppose the ban from the chemistry lab was enough."

    "I nod slowly, wondering where this is all going."

    "Muto snaps back to the present. It's almost like talking with Rin, only Muto seems to have more of a penchant for explosives."

    mu "So I did a lot of physics too. Still used explosives and such, only that way I didn't have to make 'em myself anymore."

    mu "Then I went back to chemistry, because nobody would make things for me after the damage to the football field."

    hi "What?"

    mu "Not a big fan of straight math. Less explosions and firing things out of cannons."

    hi "You're saying I should study science at university?"

    "Muto seems thrown off balance by my question."

    mu "Well, sort of."

    mu "You could also join the science club!"

    mu "Well, not really. There's not actually a science club."

    mu "But there could be!"

    mu "You could even be a charter member!"

    hi "What's it about?"

    mu "Time. Space. Space-time. Black holes and such."

    mu "And it's not that dense."

    mu "Just to see if that sort of thing's interesting for you, you understand."

    mu "Hang around after class and we can either discuss it or I can show you how to make explosives in the lab."

    mu "Or both."

    "There were simply too many things to think about."

    "My mind refused to slow down."

    "Instead I replayed the rooftop, the park, and everything in between over and over in my mind."

    "There's a small part of my mind that is still paranoid that this has all been some kind of joke."

    "That I'll meet up with Emi at the track and she'll act like nothing happened yesterday."

    "Pushing these thoughts to the back of my mind, I throw on my running clothes and open the door."

    "Emi's waiting for me with her usual smile."

    emi "You're late!"

    emi "Or at least, you're not early today."

    emi "Are you tired or something?"

    "I find myself ruefully rubbing the back of my head."

    hi "Something like that, yeah."

    hi "Lots to think about and all that."

    "Emi giggles at my mild understatement."

    emi "Yeah, I didn't sleep that well either."

    emi "I was actually glad you weren't early, 'cause I wasn't early either."

    "I wonder if the same thing kept us awake."

    "The image of her weeping face passes through my mind."

    hi "What kept you up?"

    "Emi's expression falters, but she quickly notices my curiosity and gives me a forced smile."

    emi "Nothing important."

    "She's obviously not telling me something."
    #I wonder what it is~

    "The question is, should I press the issue?"

    "Something's clearly been bothering her for a while."

    "I want to help her, but would it just come off as me being nosy?"

    "She's got to know I care about her, though."

    hi "Are you sure?"

    hi "If something's bothering you, I'm here to help you sort it out."

    "Emi laughs then, but it's not her usual laugh. There's an edge to it that seems almost bitter."

    emi "Sort it out?"

    emi "I don't think it can be sorted out, Hisao."

    "An almost grim smile crosses her lips."

    "It's like a smile of resignation."

    emi "I'm not sure you could help me, anyway."
    #Of course he can help.
    #With sweet, sweet love.
    
    "That hurts."

    "I don't want to say that it hurts to her, but it does."

    "Doesn't she realize I want to be there for her when things go wrong?"

    hi "Well, I won't push you on the matter."

    hi "But I'm here for you if you decide later that you'd like to talk about it."

    hi "It might help."

    "I can see the debate raging behind Emi's eyes."

    "It seems like she wants to tell me, but she's not sure whether or not she can."

    hi "Hey, forget about it for now, okay?"

    hi "We've got running to do."

    "The mention of running, something that she can handle, brings Emi back to her usual self."

    emi "Right!"

    emi "Hurry up and stretch out, Hisao!"

    emi "We've got to get moving!"

    "She takes off like a shot, far quicker than I'm used to."

    "Still, I try to keep pace with her, recklessly testing my limits."

    "It gives me a feeling of freedom, like my heart is no longer important."

    "I find myself wanting to laugh, filled with the feeling of moving beyond what I once called my boundaries."

    "The nurse's warnings to not overdo things echo in my mind, and I disregard them."

    "This feeling I've got—this willingness to risk a heartattack for something so trivial as a morning run, feels out of character for me."

    "But is it?"

    "Or rather, should it be?"

    "I've got a weak heart, sure."

    "It'll never be capable of the sorts of speed and endurance Emi's capable of."

    "Though I probably wouldn't be able to get that good if I head a healthy heart."

    "But this feeling of freedom I'm experiencing right now, isn't that worth a little risk?"
    
    "As we round the final bend, I feel my legs screaming in protest, but for the first time, I ignore them."

    "I accelerate to finish at a sprint, nearly catching up to Emi."

    "That was never going to happen, of course."

    "Still, I feel surprisingly good."

    "Oh sure, my legs feel like they're about to catch fire, and I'm having trouble staying upright."

    "But there's been a shift of some sort today."
    
    "And it's all thanks to the girl grinning at the finish line, waiting for me."
    
    hi "That was a bit faster than usual, don't you think?"

    "My comment is met with a grin and a shrug."

    emi "Can't have you think I was going to go soft on you, now can I?"
    
    emi "But you managed to handle it just fine."

    hi "Well I couldn't have done it without you."
    
    "Still feeling the high from the run, and moved by a surge of gratitude, I seize Emi in a hug."
    
    hi "Thanks."

    hi "Really, I'm not just saying that."

    hi "I'm in your debt."

    "Emi seems flustered by my words, squirming uncomfortably."

    emi "Don't be silly, Hisao."

    emi "Someone had to haul you out here, didn't they?"

    emi "And it's not like you're not doing anything for me, right?"

    emi "I needed a running partner, remember?"

    "I shake my head, still pointedly not letting go of Emi, who stops squirming and merely looks up at me with a quickly deepening blush that almost seems out of character."

    hi "No, that's not true."

    hi "You wanted a running partner, but you didn't need one."

    hi "If I hadn't shown up the day after the festival, you still would have run, right?"

    hi "But it doesn't work the other way around."

    hi "I only managed to make it out a few times before the festival."
    
    hi "And without you…"

    hi "I probably wouldn't have made it out at all after that."

    "Emi smiles at me and prods my chest with one finger."

    emi "You are pretty lazy, Hisao."

    hi "Hey, I was giving you a compliment!"

    emi "Well… you're welcome, I guess."

    hi "I'll pay you back somehow."

    emi "Oh, uh, well…"

    emi "That's not necessary, you know."

    emi "I mean I kinda like you, Hisao."

    emi "And being able to run with you in the mornings isn't exactly a bad deal for me either, so…"
    
    "For someone who gets so much praise, she seems unused to gratitude."

    "I can't think of anything else to say, so we fall silent."

    "Some part in the back of my mind feels the need to inform me of how long we've been standing together."

    "I become aware of Emi's breathing, of the dampness of her clothing, and of the scent of her."

    "Coming off of anyone else, it would stink."

    "Coming off of Emi, it fits her in a way nothing else could."

    "Her skin is cool, slick with sweat, and a breeze causes goosebumps to rise."

    "Almost without thinking about it, I lean down and meet Emi's mouth which has already moved to meet my own."

    "It's an odd thing about kissing Emi."

    "She grins as we kiss, a movement of her mouth against mine that tugs at my own mouth, leaving me no other option but to to grin as well."

    "Today, she giggles."

    "A girlish giggle whose vibrations travel from her mouth to mine."

    "I feel like I could die happily here, now, at this exact moment."

    "But stronger than that feeling is the desire to stay here, stay with her."

    "The kiss ends, and I finally let my arms drop back to my sides."

    "Emi is smiling warmly at me, and giggles again."

    emi "Come on Hisao, we'd better go see the nurse."

    "Then it happens."

    "As she turns to begin walking, she gives out a tiny yelp and stumbles forward."

    hi "Emi!"

    "I leap to steady her, and notice with some concern that she's favoring the same leg as last night."

    hi "Your leg…"

    "Emi seems panicked, and pushes away from me."

    emi "It's fine!"

    "My expression must seem hurt, because she hastens to apologize."

    emi "Sorry! Sorry!"

    emi "Didn't mean to push you like that!"

    emi "I was just…"

    "She stumbles for something to say."

    emi "It's nothing, really."

    hi "Hey, don't worry about it."

    "She's so flustered, I decide to shrug the whole thing off."

    "But there's a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach now that won't go away."

    "I tried to step in and help her, and she pushed me away."

    "Smiling, I shove those thoughts to the back of my mind and concentrate on Emi."

    hi "I just don't want you getting hurt, that's all."

    emi "You don't have to worry about me, honest."

    emi "I'm fine!"

    "Yes, you say that but I don't believe you."

    emi "Come on Rin, you too."
    
    "Rin has apparently dozed off, so Emi kicks her awake."
    
    rin "I almost had it."
    
    emi "Sorry, but you need to go to class."
    
    rin "I disagree, but maybe if I nap in class I'll get it this time."
    
    rin "Changing location is sometimes helpful for that kind of thing."
    
    "Neither Emi or I bother asking what “it” is."
    
    "As we arrive at my classroom, Emi gives me a quick kiss and heads down the hallway, Rin in tow."

    shi "…"
    
    "Misha seems to be fighting a losing battle to keep from breaking into a fit of giggles while she translates Shizune's latest rant."
    
    mi "While we are pleased, nay thrilled, to see how well you've managed to make new friends and forge relationships—and with such a cutie, too Hicchan~…"
    
    "I think that last part was probably Misha."
    
    shi "…"
    
    mi "We nevertheless feel compelled to politely remind you that public displays of affection are strictly forbidden—really?  That's disappointing, Shicchan—by section eight of the code of conduct laid out in the student handbook."
    
    shi "…"
    
    mi "In this case, however, ignorance of the law may be your excuse, as we are feeling lenient and the paperwork required to punish the both of you would only add to the already mountainous volume of work which confronts us, the sole members of the student council—and besides, you two are adorable together~!"
    
    shi "…"
    
    mi "Therefore consider this a formal warning, and please refrain from such displays in the future.  At least when Shizune can see you, Hicchan~!"
    
    "This whole spiel is so patently ridiculous that I can't help but reply in the same pompous manner."
    
    hi "Well, I for one feel enlightened."
    
    hi "I apologize profusely for my rash actions and will strive to contain my baser impulses which, I fear, impel me toward such inappropriate displays of public affection."
    
    hi "It is hardly my wish to burden an already overworked Student Council with such petty matters, and will do my best to make your lives easier in this matter in the future."
    
    hi "At least, when Shizune's watching."
    
    "This last line is delivered with a wink to Misha, who finally loses control of her laughter."

    mi "Well said, Hicchan~!"

    "Class is uneventful, and after the final bell rings, I find myself alone with Muto again."
    
    mu "So, the second meeting of the Science Club!"
    
    mu "Or is it the first?"
    
    mu "What do you think, should we count yesterday as a meeting?"
    
    hi "Well, we did form the club yesterday, didn't we?"
    
    hi "That seems like club business, so we can safely call yesterday a meeting."
    
    "Muto seems delighted by my response."
    
    mu "Very good!"
    
    mu "Logical thinking!  Yes, that's brilliant!"
    
    mu "You really do have a knack for this sort of thing, don't you Hisao?"
    
    hi "I guess so?"
    
    mu "No no no, Hisao."
    
    mu "A scientist speaks with authority."
    
    mu "When the world wants to know how it works, we tell it."
    
    "He grins"
    
    mu "Even if all we've got is a really, really good guess."
    
    mu "But we must sound certain anyway, because we're authorities on the subject, right?"
    
    "This seems to amuse him even more, and he breaks off into a chuckle for a moment before continuing."
    
    mu "That's a complete load of crap, of course."
    
    mu "We know a lot, sure, but nobody's an expert on how the world works."
    
    mu "If only because nobody can be sure."
    
    mu "And with no certainty, there's no experts."
    
    mu "But we like to pretend, sometimes."
    
    hi "And there's some things we can be certain of, right?"
    
    mu "Oh, of course.  We know gravity's there, for example."
    
    "To illustrate, Muto picks up a pencil and drops it."
    
    mu "See?  Still there."
    
    mu "But it's good to check every once in a while."
    
    mu "That's why you'll still see researchers mucking about with gravity."
    
    mu "We're pretty sure we know how it works, but there's always a chance that something isn't how we think it is."
    
    mu "So you check, and check, and check."
    
    mu "That's science in a nutshell, Hisao."
    
    "The whole time I've listened feeling rather spellbound."
    
    "Muto seems to really be passionate about this stuff."
    
    "I'll admit, I think I feel some of that passion rubbing off on me."
    
    "How the world works…"
    
    "How humans work."
    
    "How the universe works."
    
    "All these questions to be answered."
    
    "And hell, depending on what I go into, maybe I could even figure out a way to fix my heart."
    
    "Although I don't think that's a real priority for me."
    
    "Besides, as we start discussing the book he gave me yesterday, I find myself more and more interested in that than my heart condition."
    
    "Before we even realize it, an hour's gone by."
    
    mu "Well, let's call this meeting over for now, okay?"
    
    mu "We'll have another meeting…tomorrow, or uh…the day after."
    
    "He considers this for a moment."
    
    mu "Call it the day after."
    
    mu "I've got a lot grading to do."
    
    hi "Okay."
    
    hi "See you then."
    
    "As I exit the classroom, I realize that I don't really have anything to do tonight."
    
    "Emi and I didn't make plans, so…"

    hi "I remember you saying something of the sort earlier, but how do you know?"
    
    "Yuuko leans in closer and, if possible, whispers even lower."
    
    yu "Because I found one of his hiding places!"
    
    hi "You did what?"
    
    "Yuuko looks triumphant."
    
    yu "Found one of his stashes!"
    
    yu "It was under one of the stairwells in the boy's dorm!"
    
    yu "Three books I'd been looking for, all there!"
    
    yu "I'd suspected a thief before, but this proves it!"

    "Yuuko looks as if I've just suggested she walk around naked."
    
    yu "Are you nuts?"
    
    yu "He can't know I'm on to him!"
    
    yu "He might go to ground and evade capture!"

    hi "So what do you need my help with, then?"
    
    "Yuuko casts another glance around the library and leans in closer."
    
    yu "You've got to spy for me."
    
    hi "Spy?"
    
    yu "Yeah, like when you're in the dorms, you know."
    
    yu "Keep an eye out for suspicious activity."
    
    "What constitutes suspicious, anyway?"
    
    "I mean Kenji's a pretty suspicious dude, but I'll wager he barely goes to class, much less sneaks into the library to pilfer books."
    
    "Still, what's the harm in saying yes?"
    
    "At the least it'll get me out of this weird conversation."
    
    hi "Yeah, I can do that."
    
    hi "No problem."

    yu "Great!"
    
    yu "Now, hurry up and talk about something else in case someone comes in!"

    hi "And uh, we kinda started dating."
    
    "I have no idea why I mention this fact to Yuuko."
    
    "Probably because she just seems like the sort of person who'd want to know."
    
    "Or maybe because I just want to tell someone about it."
    
    "I mean it's not every day you get a girlfriend."
    
    "So the desire to tell people about it is, I confess, a little strong."
    
    "Yuuko claps her hands together excitedly."
    
    yu "Really? That's great!"
    
    yu "I'll bet you two are great together!"
    
    yu "I love seeing people find one another like that, you know?"
    
    yu "I even thought to myself when you walked into the Shanghai that one time, “I wonder if that kid will wind up with one of those girls.”"
    
    hi "…Really?"
    
    "Yuuko doesn't seem to notice my somewhat weirded out tone and nods affirmatively."
    
    yu "Yup! I could tell that you'd wind up with one of them, you know."
    
    yu "I've got an eye for that sort of thing."
    
    yu "Of course…"

    yu "Oh, it's true."
    
    yu "I met this guy once…"
    
    yu "We got along really great, but it turned out he was younger than me."
    
    yu "And that was kinda weird, but not terribly so."
    
    yu "What was really weird was that he disappeared one day and I've not seen him since."
    
    hi "Huh. That does seem kind of odd."
    
    yu "Doesn't it?"
    
    yu "I hope it wasn't something I did…"
    
    "I feel compelled to reassure her."
    
    hi "I'm sure it wasn't."
    
    "I half-expect to have to elaborate, but this seems to calm down Yuuko."
    
    yu "You don't think it was because he was—" #reminder for the potential {nw} break

    yu "Yes, he's here."

    hi "What's wrong?"

    emi "Can you just…"
    
    emi "Can you stop by?"
    
    emi "Like, now? Or shortly after now?"
    
    emi "I really, really need to talk to you."

    hi "Of course, I'll be right there."
    
    hi "Hold steady, okay?"
    
    "In my increasingly agitated state I've apparently started saying things that don't quite make sense."
    
    emi "Okay. I'll be okay."
    
    hi "See you soon."
    
    "I hang up the phone, apologize to Yuuko for running off, and run off."
    
    #off we go to the girl's dorm
    
    "Perhaps at some point I would have stopped to think about the lateness of the hour, or how suspicious it looks for a guy to enter the girl's dorm at this hour."

    "Emi's there, yes."
    
    "But she's in a wheelchair."
    
    "And her legs are missing. I glance around the room and see them sitting in a corner, looking like they've been thrown there."
    
    "Emi responds to my entrance with a lopsided grin that is both pleased to see me and completely, utterly heartbroken."
    
    hi "Emi? What happened?"
    
    emi "Guess I should've listened to you, Hisao."
    
    emi "My leg's got a nasty infection. I'm not allowed to run on it for at least a couple of weeks."
    
    "She gives a bitter laugh that shouldn't be coming from her."
    
    emi "Heh, I can't even walk on it."
    
    emi "I could have used a crutch and kept one of my legs, but I didn't see the point."
    
    emi "Why hop? You can't run on one leg."
    
    emi "At least this way I can still, I dunno, roll fast or something."
    
    hi "Y-yeah, that's good, right?"
    
    "My awkward attempt to look on the bright side seems appreciated."
    
    "But not really effective."
    
    "Emi shrugs again."
    
    emi "It's just… kind of a nuisance."
    
    emi "I mean, we can't even eat up on the roof now."
    
    emi "No wheelchair access."
    
    hi "Yeah, but that's not a big deal, right?"
    
    hi "I mean we can still eat together, and that's the important thing."
    
    "That lopsided grin again. It hurts to look at."
    
    emi "I suppose so, yeah."
    
    emi "But like I said, it's a nuisance."
    
    emi "I mean, I haven't used a wheelchair extensively in…"
    
    "She thinks for a minute."
    
    emi "Maybe seven years? Something like that, anyway."
    
    emi "A long time."
    
    emi "I'm afraid I'm a bit out of practice."
    
    hi "Well, fortunately it's only temporary, right?"
    
    "Emi nods"
    
    emi "Oh yeah, of course."
    
    emi "It's not like I've lost 'em permanently."
    
    emi "But it's a pain in the ass all the same."
    
    "I nod sympathetically."
    
    "There's not much else I can do, after all."
    
    "What am I gonna do, say “I told you so?”"
    
    "Although I {b}did{/b} tell her to get that leg looked at."
    
    "But by the time I noticed, it was too late anyway."
    
    hi "Do you need help with anything?"
    
    hi "Er, that is, can I help with anything?"
    
    "Emi shakes her head and there's a bit of her usual grin back."
    
    emi "Nah, I can manage fine by myself."
    
    emi "Although if you want to help me over to my bed, it would save me the trouble of rolling over there myself."
    
    "I blush, in spite of myself."
    
    "Emi giggles."
    
    emi "You're such a prude, Hisao."
    
    hi "I'm not a prude! I just wouldn't want to take advantage of a young woman such as yourself."
    
    hi "It's ungentlemanly."
    
    "I wheel Emi's chair to her bed, and easily scoop her up and deposit her there."
    
    "She's actually a little heavier than she looks."
    
    "It would be rude of me to observe this aloud, of course."
    
    hi "Man, you're kind of heavy."
    
    "Emi hits me with a pillow."
    
    emi "Ass."
    
    hi "Just sayin' is all."
    
    hi "Must be all that running."
    
    "At the mention of running Emi's grin falters slightly."
    
    emi "Heh, well I guess I won't have to worry about that for a bit, huh?"
    
    emi "Maybe I'll lose some weight."
    
    "She shuffles to the side so taht I can sit down next to her, and I do so gratefully."
    
    hi "That's what you do to lose weight, right? Cease physical activity?"
    
    emi "I'm pretty sure that's what the nurse would recommend."

    "She's leaning forward, trying to cover the fact that she's crying by covering her eyes with a hand."
    
    "Of course, the subdued sobbing makes it pretty obvious that she's crying."
    
    hi "Hey, I'm sorry."
    
    hi "Forget I said anything, okay?"
    
    "I place a hand gingerly around her and pull her close."

    hi "Sorry."

    emi "Don't say that."
    
    emi "I'm fine, really."
    
    "Her voice is slightly muffled by my chest. I pat her head reassuringly."

    "Emi lifts her head and stares at me with tear-stained eyes."
    
    emi "Can you? Can you really?"
    
    "She's grinning lopsidedly, and something sparkles in her gaze."
    
    "I can't tell if I'm being mocked or not."
    
    hi "Of course. I mean sure, you're a bit heavy, but—mmph!"
    
    "My witty comment is cut off by the sudden press of Emi's lips on mine."
    
    "I'm caught off guard, and am rewarded by hitting my head on the wall behind her bed."
    
    hi "Ow."
    
    "Emi pulls back, trying not to look concerned rather than like she's about to laugh."
    
    emi "Are you okay?"
    
    emi "Sorry!"
    
    "I rub my head ruefully and grin back at her."

    emi "Honestly, those two…"
    
    emi "If I didn't know why, I'd be utterly confused as to why she hangs around with such an authoritarian."
    
    hi "Which one are we talking about?"
    
    "Emi laughs."
    
    emi "You know exactly which one, Hisao. Misha's hardly authoritarian."
    
    hi "So what's the reason, then?"
    
    emi "Huh?"
    
    hi "The reason Misha hangs around Shizune."
    
    emi "Er, that's not my place to say."

    emi "We…talked about it once."
    
    hi "I see."
    
    "Emi raises an eyebrow at me."
    
    emi "What's that mean, “I see?”"
    
    emi "Anyway, you seem to be forgetting the original question, don't you?"
    
    hi "Oh yeah, I guess I am."
    
    hi "You wouldn't mind giving a guy a little warning, would you?"

    emm "Honestly I doubt that artist friend of hers would ever have made friends if Emi hadn't talked to her."

    emm "I don't know if you've met her, but she's an odd one."

    emi "Hey, Rin's just… unique, that's all."

    "The interior of the house is modestly furnished, almost reminiscent of my own house."

    "Emi's mother gestures toward the sitting room."

    emm "Well don't just stand there, sit down! I'll put on some tea."
    
    emm "I'm afraid I don't have much else to offer."

    emm "Normally I'm not the one having company."

    hi "That's fine, thank you."

    "Emi's mother smiles and exits the room."

    "Emi leans in and whispers conspiratorially in my ear."

    emi "Mom spends a lot of time out of the house these days."

    emi "Dad liked to play host, but Mom never did."

    "She smiles wistfully at some distant memory."

    emi "He always used to throw these parties after my track meets."

    emi "It's where Rin and I got the practice from."

    hi "Really? That's kind of cool."

    emi "Yeah."

    "A comfortable silence descends, and my gaze wanders around the room."

    "I don't notice that Emi's slipped her arm around my shoulder until she pulls me into a quick kiss."

    "The sound of footsteps causes us to break away from one another quickly as Emi's mother returns, bearing a few mugs of tea."

    emm "There we are, some tea for you both. I don't suppose you'd want anything to put in it, would you?"

    hi "This is fine, thanks."

    "Mrs. Ibarazaki nods and sits down in a chair across from us."

    emm "Good. I don't know that I've got anything, anyway."

    emm "I don't really drink tea that often."

    emm "I'm more of a coffee person, and I tend to drink that black."

    "Emi rolls her eyes impatiently."

    emi "Go ahead and ask him, mom. I know you want to."

    "Emi's mother chuckles at her daughter's statement."

    emm "No tact, Emi. These things must be gradually built to."

    "She smiles at me apologetically."

    emm "I'm sure you've learned that Emi has a way with words by now."

    emm "At least, I assume you have."

    emm "You've been dating my daughter, after all. Right?"

    emi "See? That wasn't hard at all!"

    "Watching the two of them interact with one another is immensely entertaining."

    "I almost forget that I was asked a question, until I notice that both Emi and Mrs. Ibarazaki are staring at me expectantly."

    hi "Oh, er."

    hi "Yes, I've been dating your daughter."

    hi "I was hoping to continue to do so, if that's okay."

    "Emi's mother beams, delighted by my answer."

    emm "That's wonderful! I was beginning to worry that Emi didn't have an interest in boys."

    "Emi's head jerks up sharply."

    emi "Hey!"

    "I choke on my tea with laughter, nearly spilling my mug in the process."

    "Emi crosses her arms pouts."

    emi "…ONE time in the art room and all of a sudden everyone thinks I don't like boys…"

    hi "Huh?"

    emi "Nothing!"

    "I guess she didn't realize she was speaking out loud."

    emi "Well, I've got to go to the bathroom! Play nice, you two!"

    "Emi darts out of the room with a slight pink tinge to her cheeks."

    "I'll have to ask her about that some time."

    "I have more pressing matters to attend to right now."

    "Namely, a way to carry on a conversation with Emi's mother."

    hi "Er, so…"

    emm "How long have you two been dating?"

    "Emi's mother rescues me from accidentally asking, “How long have you known Emi?”"

    hi "Uh, not very long. A couple of weeks, I think."

    "I'm not actually sure."

    "Time has been blurring together for me recently."

    "I blame exams."

    emm "I see. And did you know her for very long before that?"

    hi "Yeah, I met her on my first day."

    hi "I just transferred in recently."

    emm "Oh? Why's that?"

    hi "Well, I didn't know that I had any problems until a little while ago."

    "Emi's mother nods sympathetically."

    emm "Emi went through a similar experience when she lost her legs."

    emm "Have you found it difficult to adjust?"

    hi "It was a little weird, but I basically just have to remember to take pills and exercise."

    hi "So it's not that bad."

    "Another nod."

    emm "You're one of the lucky ones, I guess."

    "She gets a far off look in her eyes."

    emm "Then again, I suppose Emi adjusted fairly quickly to her new situation after the accident."

    emm "Sometimes I think it took me more effort to adjust than her."

    "A dry laugh, carrying some great weight with it, hangs in the air."

    emm "Heh, but that's silly of me."

    emm "Emi's really a strong one. She's very responsible."

    "Are we talking about the same Emi?"

    "Emi, the girl consistently running behind, responsible?"

    hi "Really?"

    "Mrs. Ibarazaki notices my disbelief and smiles."

    emm "I didn't say she was organized."

    emm "But responsible? Yes, quite responsible."

    emm "If she makes a decision to do something, nothing stops her from getting it done."

    emm "Well, you should have experienced that first hand if you're the one running with her in the mornings."

    hi "I guess you're right. The only day she missed was when the Nurse forced her to stay in bed sick."

    emm "Oh, so you've met the Nurse, have you?"

    emm "He's been a great help to us."

    hi "He mentioned that he'd known Emi for a while."

    "Emi's mother nods in confirmation."

    emm "He's been with Emi since her first set of legs."

    emm "He comes by for dinner every so often; it's the least I can do for him."

    hi "He's pretty proud of Emi."

    emm "I think she's like the little sister he never had."

    "Interesting choice of words."

    hi "He's certainly protective of her, that's for sure."

    emm "What do you mean?"

    hi "Heh, it's just that he warned me not to hurt Emi when he found out we were dating."

    "Well, threatened is more accurate, but I don't feel the need to tell Mrs. Ibarazaki that."

    "Amusement creeps across her face."

    emm "That's not surprising."

    emm "I'd asked him to keep an eye on Emi at school since I couldn't."

    emm "Good to know he's followed through on his promise."

    hi "Quite enthusiastically."

    emm "Oh? Threatened to mix up your medications, did he?"

    hi "Actually, yes."

    hi "Yes he did."

    "Laughter echoes through the sitting room."

    emm "I dared him to do that last time he was over, you know."

    emm "Certainly didn't expect him to follow through with it though…"

    emm "Guess I owe him another dinner, then."

    emi "Owe who a what now?"

    "Emi suddenly returns from her trip to the bathroom, looking cheery as ever."

    "Her mother smiles and avoids the question."

    emm "Are you ready to go then, dear?"

    emi "Yeah, let's go."

    hi "Go where?"

    "Emi's mother seems confused."

    emm "You didn't tell him?"

    "Emi looks guiltily at me and shrugs."
    #Since an alpha tester will inevitably say NOT A WORD LOL, it is. It just doesn't look like one.

    emi "I forgot to mention it."

    hi "Mention what?"

    emi "Well, it's the anniversary."

    emi "That's why I came back."

    "Anniversary?"

    "Anniversary of what?"

    "Oh."

    "Wait a minute."

    "I think I can guess."

    emi "You don't have to come, I just, er…"

    "I cut her off before she can go any further."

    hi "Of course I'll come with you."

    "Emi seems relieved by my answer and grins."

    "The bus ride back from Emi's house took forever."

    "Apparently there was an accident on the road, so we had to take a detour."

    "Emi was silent for the majority of the ride home, which wasn't that surprising."

    "Once we made it back to the school, she gave me a kiss and said she'd see me later."

    "I was feeling tired myself, so I had merely said goodbye and headed back to my room."

    "I didn't even bother with dinner."

    "Instead, I took my medication and slept."

    "Now the early morning light has rudely awakened me."

    "It takes me a few minutes to realize that I'm not alone."

    "There's a warm weight on my chest that can only be Emi."

    "Odd. I don't remember her coming in."

    "That look of a deep-down hurt in her eyes."

    "The way her voice cracked as she tried to describe what happened."

    "More than anything I think it was hearing that voice that I'd heard laugh so often breaking under the weight of emotion that disturbed me."

    "A musical laugh heralds the presence of Emi's mother, who appears behind the Nurse looking remarkably pleased with herself."

    emm "Couldn't resist making it a surprise."

    emm "You're a fan of surprises, right?"

    hi "The whole trip was a surprise to me."

    "Mrs. Ibarazaki adopts a worried expression."

    emm "I hope you aren't too disappointed."

    hi "Oh please, who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to visit here?"

    "The Nurse receives a joking nudge in the small of his back from the woman behind him."

    emm "This one, for starters. Always making excuses…"

    "The injured party responds with a hurt tone to his voice."

    nk "Ah! Such slander! You know full well that I'm down here before you even hang up the phone."

    "Emi's mother rolls her eyes and huffs in disbelief."

    emm "Liar. I have to drag you down here."

    nk "Oh please, you Ibarazaki women are such exaggerators."

    "I'm sure the two would have continued to go back and forth forever if Emi hadn't spoken up."

    emi "So are you two going to stand there and argue all day, or do we get to come inside?"

    "The two jump slightly, as if they'd forgotten we were there."

    nk "Of course you can come in! I would have let you in immediately if your mother hadn't started telling such lies."

    "This earns him another prod in the back."

    emm "Inviting people into my house, are we? You thinking about living here, hmm?"

    "The Nurse laughs as he moves out of the way, but I'd almost swear he blushes a little."

    nk "Well you're being such a poor hostess, I figured someone had to pick up the slack…"

    "Bantering back and forth, the Nurse and Emi's mom escort us inside."

    "The smell of something delicious cooking wafts from the kitchen."

    "Emi shoots upstairs to use the bathroom, leaving me to exchange pleasantries with her mother and the Nurse."

    emm "Would you like some tea? Dinner won't be ready for another twenty minutes, I don't think."

    hi "That would be fine, thanks."

    "The Nurse waves idly in the direction of the kitchen."

    nk "I'll have some tea as well, if you're handing them out."

    emm "I was offering to the guest, not to you."

    nk "I'm not a guest?"

    emm "You're more of an adopted stray than a guest…"

    "I can't help burst into laughter at Mrs. Ibarazaki's frank declaration."

    "The Nurse adopts a hurt expression."

    nk "Ah, I was afraid of this! You feel like I'm around too much. Very well, I know when I'm not wanted…"

    "He makes to leave, only to be intercepted by Emi as he mournfully makes his way to the front door."

    emi "Hey, where do you think you're going?"

    nk "Your mother doesn't want me here."

    "He delivers this line in an injured tone, face drawn down into a mock frown."

    "At this, Emi places her hands on her hips and shouts into the kitchen."

    emi "Mom! Quit teasing the Nurse so much! You know he's delicate!"

    nk "Hey, I'm not delicate!"

    nk "How could I be? I hang out with you guys all the time!"

    emi "Hey! Are you saying we're not delicate?"

    nk "About as delicate as a…hmm…"

    nk "Hisao!"

    hi "Huh?"

    nk "What's something that's not delicate at all?"

    emi "Hey!"

    hi "I'm not answering that."

    nk "Aw man, leaving me in the lurch, Hisao? That's not cool."

    "I give a sympathetic shrug to the Nurse, who has since been dragged forcibly back into the sitting room."

    hi "Sorry, but I value my life."

    nk "Hmm…I don't blame you."

    "He fidgets for a bit before shooting a glance toward the kitchen doorway."

    nk "I'd better go make sure she's not burned herself making the tea."

    "Emi giggles as he exits the room."

    emi "“Make sure she's not burned herself” indeed."

    hi "Huh? What's that supposed to mean?"

    "Emi sighs and gives me a look normally reserved for the mentally impaired."

    emi "Honestly Hisao, you're a little slow at picking up on some things, aren't you?"

    emi "It's a lucky thing I made the first move, or we'd never have gotten anywhere."

    hi "Hey, I had my suspicions!"

    hi "I just didn't…think they were right, is all."

    "I cross my arms and adopt a defensive expression."

    hi "Plus there was the track captain to consider."

    "Emi giggles."

    emi "Only because you didn't know he was gay."

    emi "Which only reinforces my point, you know?"

    emi "Some things you just don't pick up on."

    "A muffled “Eep” and the sound of something being dropped heralds the return of the Nurse, grinning like a madman."

    nk "Hey! Tea's fine."

    "Emi's mother charges out of the kitchen with a slight flush to her cheeks, raises a hand as if she's about to say something, thinks better of it, giggles, grins, turns around, and heads back into the kitchen without a word."

    "I have no idea what transpired in that kitchen, and I'm not sure I want to know."

    "A few moments later, she appears again with a few cups of tea for myself and Emi—but not, I note, for the Nurse."

    "He notes too."

    nk "Hey, you forgot mine!"

    "This earns him a swift whack over the back of his head that looks like it hurts."

    emm "I told you to get your own tea."

    emm "Idiot."

    nk "Fine, fine."

    nk "We'll call this an apology for earlier, then."

    "Another glare from Mrs. Ibarazaki, though it's coupled with a very Emi-ish grin."

    emm "Only if you bring me a cup as well."

    "The Nurse bows low."

    nk "Of course, of course. I wouldn't dream of forgetting."

    "Emi's mother sniffs haughtily."

    emm "See that you don't."

    "This merits a giggle from Emi, who looks at the two participants in this conversation and shakes her head in amusement."

    emi "Honestly, you two…"

    $ doublespeak (emm, nk, "What?")

    emi "Haha, nothing, nothing."

    emi "Aren't you supposed to be getting some tea for my mother, Nurse?"

    "The Nurse seems briefly intrigued by Emi's subject change, but shrugs and heads for the kitchen. Her mother, on the other hand, only smiles slightly and waves imperiously at her guest's retreating back."

    emm "Don't spill any, or you'll have to clean it up."

    nk "Hey, I'm not the clumsy one."

    emm "What's that supposed to mean?"

    nk "You did drop that cup, you know."

    emm "Only because you—" #reminder for the potential {nw} break

    "Instead of finishing her sentence, Mrs. Ibarazaki coughs, looking a little embarrassed."

    emm "Er, well."

    emm "I'm still not the clumsy one, is my point."

    "Something about their interaction seems familiar."

    "I frown, trying to remember what it reminds me of."

    emi "Something wrong, Hisao?"

    hi "Huh? Oh, no. Just trying to remember something."

    emi "Oh? What's that?"

    "I adopt an innocent expression."

    hi "I told you, I can't remember."

    hi "Otherwise I'd tell you."

    "Emi rolls her eyes and gives me a playful shove."

    emi "Fine, don't tell me."

    emi "I'll get it out of you later."

    hi "Ha! I'll take it to my grave!"

    emi "You say that now, but there are ways of making you talk!"

    "I cross my arms defiantly."

    hi "Do your worst."

    "Mischief lights in Emi's eyes."

    emi "Oh ho, a challenge, is it?"

    "A chuckle from the corner of the room reminds us that we're not alone."

    emm "Honestly, you two…"

    $ doublespeak (emi, hi, "What?")

    "…"

    "Ah."

    "Interesting."

    "The Nurse returns with two cups of tea, one which he hands with exaggerated courtesy to Emi's mother."

    nk "Your tea, madam."

    emm "Why thank you."

    "We sit and sip tea, passing the time until the sound of a timer cuts into a conversation about what Emi and I did this afternoon."

    emm "Ah! Dinner's ready!"

    #Hop to the dining room

    "The delicious smells turn out to be some kind of stew served with rice."

    "Fortunately, it tastes as good as it smelled."

    hi "This is delicious, Mrs. Ibarazaki."

    "Emi mumbles something that sounds like agreement, but at the rate she's inhaling her food it's hard to tell just what she's saying."

    "Her mother seems exceedingly pleased by the news."

    emm "Thank you! It's been a while since I tried a stew."

    emm "Good to know my skills haven't faded."

    nk "Ah, modesty."

    "A glare from Emi's mother causes the Nurse to chuckle."

    nk "Forgive me. It's just that you've certainly never had trouble cooking before. It's always a pleasure to eat something this delicious."

    emm "Flatterer."

    nk "Blatantly so, madam."

    "These two act a lot like myself and Emi, so much so that I'm stunned that it took so long for me to realize it."

    "I wonder if the Nurse's high school sweetheart is the woman sitting across from me."

    "He did mention something about “odd circumstances bring them back together.”"

    "I wonder if Emi knows."

    "She probably does."

    "Her mother hardly seems the type to keep secrets."

    emi "Thinking again, Hisao?"

    nk "That's a good way to hurt yourself, you know."

    hi "Hey! Teaming up is no fair!"

    "The Nurse grins."

    nk "Sorry Hisao, but you did leave me in the lurch earlier."

    emi "Besides, Nurse is expected to take my side."

    emi "I'm cuter."

    hi "Hmm, I don't suppose I can argue with that."

    "The Nurse lowers his voice conspiratorially."

    nk "If you know what's good for you, you'll not even try."

    nk "Trust me, I've learned from both of 'em."

    emm "I heard that."

    "The Nurse adopts his most innocent expression."

    nk "Heard what? I didn't say anything."

    "The mischievous look normally reserved for Emi's eyes shows up in those of her mother."

    "It's vaguely terrifying."

    emm "Oh? Liars don't get any dessert, you know…"

    nk "So beautiful, and yet so cruel…"

    nk "It's enough to make a man weep."

    "Emi tries and fails to hold back laughter."

    "I take one look at the Nurse's face, still trying hard to keep up the appearance of seriousness, and laugh as well."

    "It doesn't take long for Emi's mother and the Nurse to start laughing as well, and for a few minutes the only sound at the table is the sound of our mutual amusement."

    "After a while the laughter dies down."

    "Emi's mother stands and begins to clear the table."

    nk "Hey, need any help?"

    emm "I wouldn't hear of it. You're a guest, aren't you?"

    "Didn't she say he wasn't before?"

    "The Nurse seems to know better than to argue and holds up his hands in surrender."

    nk "You're the boss, of course."

    emm "Besides, Emi's going to help me clean up."

    emm "Right, Emi?"

    "Emi pouts theatrically."

    emi "Aww, do I have to?"

    emi "I'm a guest too, you know."

    emm "What are you talking about?"

    emm "You're my daughter! You're not a guest."

    emi "What if we weren't blood related?"

    emm "No difference to me, kiddo."

    "Emi shrugs, an expression of “Well, I tried” on her face."

    "The two Ibarazaki women have the table cleared in no time, and return with a Black Forest cake."

    emm "Compliments of the Nurse."

    hi "Looks good."

    nk "Thanks, it took me forever to make."

    emi "Nurse, it's still got the price tag on it."

    "The Nurse shrugs."

    nk "Ah well, it was worth a try."

    hi "I was almost impressed."

    nk "You should still be. I had to go into a store to buy that."

    nk "Lots of effort, you see."

    hi "I'm sure."

    "I'll say this: The cake's delicious."

    #I want it on record that I could have made a Portal reference and DIDN'T. Because I NEVER WOULD. Remember that.

    "Emi makes her piece disappear even faster than her dinner."

    emi "Wow, that was great!"

    emi "Good job, Nurse!"

    emm "Yes, you've outdone yourself."

    nk "Well, I knew it was your favorite, so I felt I couldn't go wrong."

    emm "Aw, you remembered. I'm touched."

    "Despite the fact that she said it in jest, I'm pretty sure she's serious."

    "At least, I know Emi would be if it had been her saying that."

    #living room

    "After dessert, Emi and her mother retreat to the kitchen to wash dishes whilst the Nurse and I lounge about in the living room."

    "All the food's made me a bit sleepy, and it seems like the Nurse is in a similar state."

    "We sit in silence for a while, listening to Emi and her mother banter back and forth in the kitchen."

    "Listening to them, I can't keep a grin off my face."

    nk "They really are something, aren't they?"

    hi "Huh?"

    nk "Those two in the kitchen."

    nk "A rare breed, don't you think?"

    hi "Yeah, I guess so."

    nk "Have you thought about what I said earlier?"

    hi "You know, I have."

    nk "Really?"

    hi "Yeah."

    nk "Good, good. I don't know if I was clear before, but you shouldn't be afraid to take a risk, Hisao."

    nk "Sometimes they pay off."

    hi "Like showing up here early?"

    "I try not to grin too much at the Nurse's sudden coughing fit."

    hi "Ha! I was right."

    "The Nurse grins wryly."

    nk "I don't suppose I attempted to be that discreet."

    nk "Then again, I didn't expect Emi to bring you along tonight, so there you go."

    nk "Hopefully her mother isn't as indiscreet as I am."

    "As if in answer to our question, Emi and her mother exit the kitchen, Emi giggling madly."

    hi "Wow, did we miss something?"

    emi "No, I'll uh, tell you later."

    "The Nurse sighs and shakes his head."

    nk "No such luck."

    emi "Well! Hisao and I have an early morning tomorrow."

    emi "Gotta work off that cake, after all."

    emi "Come on, Hisao."

    "Emi's mother shakes her head in resignation."

    emm "Leaving already? Well, I suppose it can't be helped."

    emm "Don't get on the wrong bus this time, okay?"

    "Emi frowns at her mother, looking a little embarrassed."

    emi "Hey! That was only once."

    emm "I know, but if I ever let you live it down you might do it again."

    emm "It's tough love."

    "I chuckle."

    emm "Hisao, you make sure that my daughter behaves herself, you hear?"

    hi "I'll do my best."

    emi "Hey! I'm a perfect angel!"

    "I stifle a laugh as we exit the house. Emi's mother waves and closes the door behind us."

    "We walk in silence for a while before I venture to ask a question."

    hi "So, why the swift exit?"

    "Emi grins excitedly."

    emi "I wanted to give mom and the Nurse some time alone."

    emi "Apparently they've finally decided to try dating."

    hi "And you're okay with that?"

    emi "Well of course! Don't get me wrong, I miss dad and I know Nurse isn't him, but still…"

    emi "Mom deserves to have someone, you know?"

    emi "And I know Nurse, he's not going to do anything stupid."

    "She's remarkably calm about all this."

    "I think I might be a little weirded out myself, but I'm not Emi, after all."

    "As we wait for the bus, I think about what the Nurse said."

    "Take risks, huh?"

    hi "Hey, Emi."

    emi "Hmm?"

    hi "Got any extra college applications?"

    #End of Act III. Not as planned, but whatever. Close enough.
