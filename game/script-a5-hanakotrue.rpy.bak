    #Act 5 (?) title card… I need to think of a title. Not really good at that. Something "final".

    "What a weekend. After leaving Lilly's room, I practically fell straight asleep…"

    "…without setting my alarm."

    "If it wasn't for a particularly shrill bird, I would have been late to class."

    "The run to beat the bells set my chest ablaze, and for all the wrong reasons."

    "Some people joke about giving themselves a heart attack in situations like that."

    "It's not so funny when it's a part of your reality."

    "But that's not the point."

    "My tardiness neglected my morning conversation with Hanako, and now that there's only a few seconds to the lunch bells, I'm itching to say “Good Morning.”"

    "…amongst other things, of course."

    "Muto finishes writing the last of the exam timetable on the board, and puts down the chalk."

    #muto serious

    mu "So ends this trimester's lessons. From now until the end of your exams is study time."

    mu "Myself and the other teachers will be available to help you."

    #Muto contemplative

    mu "But, I suppose if you have made it this far and haven't absorbed the material, there's very little we can do for you."

    "The bells ring, Muto leaves the classroom, but no-one moves."

    "The severity of his words seems to hit home with more than a few students."

    "Ashen faces fill the room, but none more ashen than the one closest to me."

    #misha sad/heh…. heh… heh

    mi "Heh… heh…"

    mi "Hey, Hisao…"

    mi "He's not serious, is he? Heh… heh…"

    "Man, I never thought anyone would knock the wind out of Misha's sails."

    "She still wears her idiotic smile, but her eyes are dead."

    "No, worse than dead."

    "From the nose up, Misha looks like a zombie."

    hi "I don't think it's that bad."

    hi "I mean, you've passed most of your tests to now, right?"

    "No change."

    "Ah well, this is amusing in its own right."

    #Shizune pissed off

    "Behind the zombified Misha, Shizune taps impatiently on the desk."

    "Misha, however, doesn't react, so I am left facing a clearly unimpressed Shizune."

    "I try to gesture “what” to her, but to no avail."

    shi "…"

    "She sighs, pushes her glasses up on her nose, and points behind me."

    hi "Eh?"

    ha "Good morning, Hisao!"

    #Show Hanako Happy

    hi "Hanako! Sorry, I got distracted, and I was late this morning, and… yeah…"

    ha "T—that's okay. I wanted to speak to Misha and Shizune, too."

    hi "Eh?"

    #Misha Eh?

    "Misha snaps out of her reverie."

    mi "Eh? You want to speak to us?"

    #hanako embarrassed

    ha "Um, well, I ended up making too much for lunch today, and you and Shizune seem to talk to Hisao a lot… and, um…"

    #mabye a more embarrassed Hanako?

    ha "I wanted to know if you wanted to join us for lunch and study…"

    extend " maybe… "

    extend "only if you wanted to…"

    #misha excited

    mi "Eh? What's this? You're asking us to come with you?!"

    mi "But you never talk to anyone!"

    ha "Um, well, I thought that you and Shizune might get lonely…"

    ha "There's no-one else on the council…"

    hi "Eh? I thought you said there were a lot of people on the council?"

    mi "There is, but there isn't."

    mi "It's like that."

    hi "Oh, I get it."

    "I don't get it."

    mi "But this is big news! Lunch! Study!"

    mi "Count us in!"

    hi "Um, shouldn't you ask Shizune first?"

    "Shizune sits directly behind Misha, who seems oblivious to her presence."

    "In fact, I think this is the longest that I think I've seen Misha go without signing something."

    mi "What? No, Whahaha. She'll pretend to say no but she'll come along."

    mi "We've seen you work in science."

    mi "We need someone like you that isn't dumb at it."

    "Misha lowers her voice."

    mi "Shizu would never admit it, but she's bad at science."

    mi "But don't tell her I told you that."

    "Behind Misha, a shadow rises."

    "Tapping on the desk didn't work."

    "Gently tapping her shoulder didn't work."

    "In a soundless vocabulary, these are the equivalent of “Excuse me” and “Hey! Misha!”"

    "Misha, however, remains oblivious."

    "The shadow winds up, and delivers possibly the most graphical “I'm Talking to You, Damn it!” that I have ever seen."

    #Misha cry/rubbing head

    mi "Ow… Shizune~"

    mi "You didn't have to do that."

    mi "Yes I did, you weren't paying attention."

    mi "But I was talking to Hisao…"

    mi "About what?"

    mi "Umm…"

    "Misha's mouth stalls, however her hands go through the pre-programmed movements, spelling out her thoughts directly to Shizune."

    mi "I should hit you again for being so insolent. Now tell me, what's going on?"

    mi "Oh, Hisao and Hanako want to study with us! Aren't we lucky?"

    #Shizune blush

    mi "Really? Well, the council has light duties during the exam period, so I think it is a good idea."

    mi "Hey, Shizu, can we use the council office?"

    mi "I don't see why not. Hisao, what do you think?"

    hi "Eh?"

    "I was so wrapped up in Misha's solo dialogue that I only barely registered my name being mentioned."

    ha "It sounds like a good idea."

    hi "Yeah, sure. But lunch first?"

    mi "Yippie~! Lunch! We can do that, right?"

    mi "You should always study on a full stomach, right?"

    "I don't even know who is talking anymore."

    mi "So, where do we go?"

    ha "Um, I asked Lilly to meet us in the usual spot, so, maybe…"

    mi "Oh, where's that?"

    hi "The roof. It's kind of our place, no-one ever goes there."

    mi "You're right! I've never been there!"

    mi "That's because it's supposed to be out of bounds."

    mi "Buu, don't be a killjoy. Hana here has invited us, we can't say no."

    mi "Hanako invited us?"

    ha "Y—yeah."

    mi "Huh. I guess we can't refuse then."

    mi "Great! Lead the way, Hisao."

    hi "Um, sure."

    "Slightly confused, I head up the narrow stairway to the roof."

    #bg roof.
    #The following scene was originally going to be my finale.
    #It will require a lot of direction.
    #hopefully we can get away without my panning and zooming.
    #You know, like a certain other rooftop scene.
    #I'll include bits that *need* to be seen.

    "The midday sun is a little blinding, but I can clearly make out three shapes sitting near each other."

    hi "Oh, the others are here…"

    mi "Others?"

    li "Ah, Hanako, Hisao, is that you?"

    ha "Y—yes Lilly. We… brought friends."

    emi "Friends?"

    rin "Brought?"

    mi "Hey, I know you?"

    $doublespeak (rin,emi,"Who?","Who?")

    emi "I was looking for Rin and…"

    rin "You were looking for me in the art room?"

    hi "I thought you lived in there…"

    ha "You are there a lot of the time."

    li "If I were to search for you, I would look there first."

    rin "Huh. I would have looked where I was first."

    mi "That makes sense."

    emi "Anyway, why are we all here?"

    mi "Hanako invited us here."

    li "Hanako did?"

    ha "I… I thought we should study together…"

    ha "We are in the same class…"

    mi "And we have the council room to ourselves."

    li "My my, I don't suppose this is to force you to actually study, is it, Hanako, Hisao?"

    #Hanako Happy blush

    ha "M…maybe."

    rin "You won't study unless you're in the Council Room?"

    rin "I guess I have the same rule."

    rin "I have never studied, nor have I been to the Council Room."

    mi "Makes sense."

    shi "…"

    mi "Oh, sorry, it doesn't."

    rin "You change your mind a lot."

    hi "She's talking for two and thinking for none."

    mi "It's true."

    mi "Hey!"

    hi "See?"

    rin "Interesting. Who are you?"

    mi "Shizune."

    mi "And I'm Misha."

    emi "Hey… now… be careful."

    hi "Of what?"

    #emi embarrassed

    emi "Nothing!"

    hi "Er, okay."

    li "So, I take it we all will be studying together?"

    ha "W—well, Hisao is good at science, and you're good at music…"

    emi "Really? I really really suck at science, can you please teach me?"

    hi "Um, I guess, but…"

    mi "Ooh, that's right, Muto likes you, he's always asking you to explain things."

    ha "Please?"

    hi "I don't really have a choice, do I?"

    li "Is the council room big enough for all of us?"

    mi "Should be. We can also have a lot of snacks while we study."

    li "Splendid. Should I bring my tea set?"

    emi "You have a tea set?"

    hi "Yeah, a good one too."

    ha "We use it all the time."

    emi "Hang on, are you two going out?"

    hi "Yes. Sorry, I didn't send out a memo yet."

    rin "Why would you do that?"

    mi "Oh, so that's why you two were together."

    hi "You didn't notice?"

    rin "She's thinking for none."

    rin "Or is that the other one?"

    "Rin looks thoroughly perplexed, but generally interested by the dual mind of Misha and Shizune."

    "It's the first time I've seen her actually animated in the least."

    li "So, Hamakichi and Shiina…"

    emi "Who?"

    hi "Shizune and Misha…"

    rin "So that's their names…"

    li "…as I was saying, Shizune and Misha will provide the room, Hisao shall provide the tuition, and I shall provide the tea."

    ha "I can make some sandwiches…"

    hi "They're pretty good…"

    li "…Hanako can provide the food…"

    emi "I can run to the shops and get some snacks really really fast."

    rin "I'm not studying, I just want to see Shizukichi and Shii…sha… more."

    rin "Shi…chi…shii…sha."

    rin "You sound like a dance."

    mi "Eh?"

    shi "…"

    "I can see Misha's tireless hands falter as Rin launches into her full “babble” mode."

    li "So, it's settled. What time shall we meet, teacher?"

    "I am set upon by six pairs of excited eyes, each seemingly more intrigued than the last."

    hi "Um, let's say three o'clock?"

    emi "Three it is! Watch me, I'll be back! Save me a seat!"

    "Emi scoffs the last of her lunch, grabs Rin's sleeve and makes a beeline for the stairwell door."

    rin "Eh? Why am I going? I want to stay with the dancers…"

    emi "Because I have no mon~ey."

    rin "I shall return, Shichishiisha."

    mi "Eh?"

    "Whilst Misha's brain tries to sort through recent proceedings, Hanako spreads out her food on a small blanket."

    "True to her word, she has made far too much for even too people."

    mi "Ooh, you did make a lot. Is it okay?"

    ha "P—please. Help yourself."

    mi "I think I will!"

    mi "Thank you for the food, Hanako."

    ha "You're welcome."

    mi "Hey, these are good!"

    hi "I told you."

    ha "T—thanks."

    li "No, thank you, Hanako."

    "Whilst the others are distracted with the food, I lean in close to Hanako."

    hi "Are you sure this is a good idea?"

    ha "I… I thought it would be better with more people."

    hi "You mean, so we study, instead of… you know…"

    #Hanako blush

    ha "S—sorta. But I… I've been in the same class as Shizune and Misha for a while now."

    ha "And they always talk to you in class, so I… I want to talk to them too."

    "I feel a smile creep across my face, and a sideways glance at Lilly confirms that she, too, is grinning."

    "Whilst there is a lot of food, before the might of the five of us, it is gone fairly quickly."

    mi "Thank you for that."

    ha "You're welcome."

    mi "Well, we have to prepare the council room for this many visitors. If you'll excuse us…"

    hi "Go ahead, I have to go back to my room to get my notes, anyway."

    mi "We'll see you there at three, then."

    "Shizune bows slightly, and Misha skips ahead of her, into the stairwell."

    li "My my, that was lively."

    hi "Indeed."

    #hanako blush smile

    ha "I… thought it was fun."

    hi "Eh?"

    ha "It was a little busy, but fun."

    hi "I think you're right there."

    li "Are you going to be alright for the study sessions?"

    hi "Sessions?"

    li "Surely we aren't going to all this trouble for one afternoon?"

    "A little piece of me dies inside. Am I going to be stuck teaching six girls for the next two weeks?"

    ha "I… I think I will be fine."

    ha "And it's less of a distraction than… than…"

    #Hanako super embarrassed

    #Lilly slight blush

    li "Oh, I suppose you are right there."

    hi "Yeah, I suppose we have no choice now."

    hi "It's hard enough getting away with one person watching, let alone five…"

    li "I wasn't watching…"

    hi "Listening, then."

    li "Hisao Nakai, are you, perchance, insinuating that I am some kind of voyeur?"

    hi "No, not at all. But you were…"

    "Lilly swings out in my direction, landing a playful punch on my back."

    "Still, I can't resist hamming it up."

    hi "Hey, ow…"

    li "Be quiet, you. I know that didn't hurt. That wasn't the point."

    #Lilly smile, Hanako laugh

    "Lilly's fake seriousness makes Hanako and I laugh, and before long she joins us in laughter."

    li "Come now, that's enough horsing around. How much longer do we have before class?"

    hi "Um, just under an hour."

    li "Well then, don't you think that you should prepare?"

    hi "Yeah, you're right. Hanako, do you need a hand?"

    ha "No, I should be fine. I'll see you there."

    "I lean over and kiss Hanako before setting off to collect my notes."

    #I should note, I didn't intend to write a 3-page lecture on gravity.
    #Stupid degree.
    #Is it worth keeping? Where should I cut it?

    mi "You know, like gravity was always mg. But now it's MM… something."

    li "I believe that Misha is referring to the equation of gravity, where the force is equal to G by M by m on r squared."

    mi "Yeah, the M&M rule."

    hi "Ah, right. Well, er, the way I remember it is like this."

    "Instinctively, I pick up the chalk and draw two circles on the board."

    "However, due to a lack of experience with chalk, the circles turn out more like blobs."

    hi "Think about two balls in space."

    shi "…"

    mi "Why in space?"

    hi "Well, it's so that we don't have anything else to worry about."

    mi "I see."

    hi "Now, what are the things that are going to matter here?"

    hi "I mean, what is there that will change the gravity?"

    "I stare down the barrel of six blank faces."

    "Teaching is hard."

    rin "Neither of them is a ball."

    li "The masses of the balls?"

    hi "Bingo."

    "I draw an M under each blob."

    ha "H—how far apart they are?"

    hi "That's right. Anything else?"

    ha "Less?"

    hi "Right again."

    hi "So now we can put them together. Can anyone guess how?"

    rin "GMm on r squared."

    hi "Uh, right. How did you know?"

    rin "She said it before."

    hi "Right. But why is it like this? Why isn't r on the top?"

    li "Since the force gets less as the distance gets bigger… that means you need to divide, and not multiply?"

    hi "Spot on."

    hi "Does that make sense?"

    mi "Then what's G?"

    hi "It's just a constant; something that just keeps everything in line."

    rin "Like white."

    hi "Eh?"

    rin "White doesn't mean much, but it fills in the blanks."

    hi "So, is everyone happy now?"

    ha "Um… what is the mg one then?"

    #Misha confused

    mi "Yeah, why does it change?"

    hi "Well, it doesn't."

    "I draw a circle around part of the gravity equation I've written on the board."

    hi "If you're standing on the earth, then these parts are going to be the same, aren't they?"

    hi "G is a constant, the mass of the earth doesn't change, and the earth is pretty much a sphere, so r is the same everywhere, right?"

    emi "Right."

    hi "So, we can work out this part, and it ends up being g."

    hi "And if you multiply that by m, you get the same thing we have here."

    mi "Ohhh."

    mi "I can almost remember that."

    hi "Almost?"

    mi "I didn't write any of it down."

    "It suddenly occurs to me that Misha never gets the chance to take notes, her hands busy signing the classes directly to Shizune."

    "I feel kind of sorry for her, in a way."

    "Then again, I get the feeling that Shizune's notes would be a lot more legibile and concise, and it's a given that she just copies off those."

    "Their symbiotic relationship never ceases to amaze me."

    "After the girls finish taking down their notes, I erase my scratchings from the board, and ask for the next question."

    "Now that the tone has been set, everyone seems to relax a little, and the questions start coming thick and fast."

    "Electrostatics, stoichiometry, redox…"

    "A full science course in an afternoon."

    "But after each one of my fumbled explanations, I can see a little more understanding in each of the faces before me."

    "And sometimes, just simply saying my thoughts out loud makes it easier to think."

    "It's a lot easier than just reading a textbook."

    "We work long into the evening, occasionally passing around boxes of snacks as I write up formula after formula on the small chalkboard."

    "The sky outside turns dark, and the only thing that stops us is the impending curfew."

    hi "I think we should call it quits there, it's getting late."

    mi "And we still have to clean up."

    li "We could all help."

    emi "Yeah, what needs to be done, teacher?"

    "It's strange. I'm having trouble concentrating on one spot, yet Misha, with the same alcohol content, is thinking straighter than ever."

    #Stay tuned for the end of the path, wherein Hisao forces Hanako to go to her old house.

    "Hanako truly is a lot more cautious with people than you'd expect."

    "But she seemed to open up to me almost straight away; even Lilly said that when we first met."

    "No matter how much I think about it, it still seems like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle."

    hi "Um, where are you two going?"

    mi "That's a secret."

    "Misha winks at me, further confusing me."

    mi "One day, I might teach you too, Hisao."

    "Misha and Emi disappear into the dark of the hallway, and their footsteps fade off into the distance."

    li "And then there were two…"

    hi "It's not like that."

    "PA" "Please make sure you take all of your belongings with you."

    "I nudge Hanako a little to wake her up."

    #Show Hanako tired

    hi "Hey, Hanako, we're almost here."

    ha "Another five minutes…"

    hi "I don't think that's allowed here."

    "Hanako rubs her eyes, and starts to remember where she is."

    ha "We're here already?"

    hi "You've been asleep for about two hours…"

    ha "Oh… sorry."

    hi "How are you feeling?"

    ha "Better. My headache has gone, I'm just a little tired."

    "No matter how much you like someone, just the slightest amount of pain can make you despise them."

    hi "Good for you. Come on, I'll help you with your bags."

    "The train slows to a stop and the doors slide open."

    "Before us lies the complex maze of platforms and escalators of Tokyo Station."

    "Swarms of people move around in pre-determined patterns like ants."

    #Hanako concerned

    hi "Are you going to be okay with this?"

    ha "I… I'll be fine."

    "Hanako clutches the handle of her bag with both hands, her fingers white with the strain."

    hi "Here, let me take that."

    ha "Eh?"

    "I reach out and try to take her bag from her."

    ha "It's okay, I've got it…"

    ha "It's not that heavy…"

    hi "Okay then, can I at least hold your arm then?"

    #Hanako embarrassed

    "After a second's thought, Hanako switches her bag to her left hand, and holds out her right."

    "I wrap my arm around hers, and we head off towards the local platforms."

    ha "So, how much further is it?"

    hi "Well, from here we'll take a local train for about half an hour, then a short bus ride…"

    hi "A little over an hour, maybe?"

    ha "Oh… okay."

    "We enter the more crowded local section of the station, and become swept away by the crowds."

    "Hanako grips my arm tightly, and I push us through the crowds to our platform."

    #BG platform-city

    "The line to my parent's house isn't as busy as the inner-city lines, and Hanako relaxes a little."

    hi "Are you holding up okay?"

    #Hanako not embarrassed but not happy.

    ha "I… I guess."

    ha "No-one is paying attention to us."

    hi "That's just what people are like around here."

    hi "No-one notices anyone. I told you it'd be fine."

    ha "Oh, is this our train?"

    hi "That's the one. Let's try and get a good seat."

    #Bg train window 2

    "The dense inner city thins slightly as our train ambles outwards."

    "Hanako returns to her slumber, leaving me alone to ponder my headache."

    "Thankfully, it has started to subside, though that may be because of my fourth headache pill this morning."

    "We transfer to the bus without incident, and before long, we stand before my parent's home."

    #BG houseX outside

    hi "This is it."

    ha "It looks… nice."

    hi "It's not much, but it does the job."

    hi "It was big enough for us, and pretty close to the city."

    ha "That's not what I meant."

    ha "It's nice to have somewhere to go back to."

    hi "Oh, I'm sorry… I didn't mean to…"

    ha "It's okay."

    hi "Come on, let's go inside."

    "I dig my old front door key out of my pocket and open the door."

    #BG random house interior.

    hi "I'm home…"

    "No answer."

    "The house is still."

    "We make our way inside, and dump our bags in the small living room."

    "On the coffee table rests a short note."

    #Sorry delta, I forgot how to declare notes

    $ written_note("Hi Hisao, thanks for coming to visit.\nSorry, but we won't be home until dinner.\nWe'll See you then.\n\nLove, Mom and Dad.")

    #RAGE

    hi "Huh, looks like we've got the place to ourselves for a while."

    ha "Oh."

    "We look awkwardly at each other for a moment, and consider the possibilities."

    hi "You know, we could…"

    #Hanako Embarrassed

    ha "Not here!"

    ha "I haven't even met your parents!"

    ha "And, well…"

    ha "I still don't feel so great."

    hi "Oh."

    hi "Fair enough."

    "To be honest, I'm not sure if my head would survive a round with Hanako."

    "Behind the dam of painkillers I can still feel the throbbing of my hangover."

    hi "So, should we go out somewhere?"

    hi "Maybe head back towards the city?"

    ha "Oh, okay."

    hi "I have a place in mind, I think you'll like it."

    ha "Sure. Lead the way…"

    #I dunno, maybe this next bit should be NVL?

    "I take Hanako by the hand, and lead her to the bus stop."

    "Both of us seem to be content enough to simply hold each other as we exchange the bus for the train."

    ha "I thought the trains to the city were going the other way."

    hi "Oh, we're not going into the city centre, we're going… somewhere else."

    #Hanako curious

    ha "Really? Where?"

    hi "It's a secret."

    ha "Tell me!"

    hi "Can't. You'll find out when we get there."

    ha "Fine then, I won't talk to you either."

    "True to her word, Hanako doesn't say a thing on the train."

    "She doesn't break her vow until we arrive at a small suburban station, about an hour from the city."

    #BG suburb station

    ha "This is…"

    hi "Yes."

    ha "How did you know?"

    hi "I had Lilly find out for me."

    ha "How did she…?"

    hi "We looked it up in the papers. Did you know they keep copies online?"

    hi "Something like this is pretty rare, you know?"

    #Hanako sad

    ha "I don't want to."

    hi "Why not?"

    ha "I said I don't want to. Let's go home."

    hi "No."

    hi "You've never been back here, have you?"

    hi "I only know how to get you this far, so you'll have to lead the way from here."

    #Hanako Crying

    ha "I don't want to!"

    hi "Well, I'm not going to force you, but I think we should at least go there."

    hi "You can't avoid it forever…"

    ha "Why not?"

    hi "Because you're hiding."

    hi "You try to pretend that nothing ever happened, but it did."

    hi "Are you going to try and hide from what happened here forever?"

    ha "B—but…"

    hi "But what?"

    hi "What happened here is in the past, you can't change it."

    hi "But if you try to ignore it, it will eat at you forever."

    hi "Is that what you want?"

    #At this stage, I'm not sure if this is going as well as I had planned.

    "Hanako doesn't reply, but simply shakes her head."

    "I check my frustration, and try to take on a milder tone."

    hi "Look, I'm here for you. If you want, we can just catch the next train home and forget about this."

    hi "But we've come all the way out here, so why not take that last step?"

    "I hold out my hand to the crying Hanako, who looks at me with lost eyes."

    "For a moment, I start to think that this may not have been my greatest idea."

    "But, even as I consider moving to the inbound platform, Hanako reaches out and takes my hand."

    ha "You promise you'll come with me?"

    hi "Of course."

    ha "No matter what?"

    hi "Not even if you try to run away from me."

    ha "O…"

    extend " okay."

    ha "It's this way… I think…"

    "Hesitantly, Hanako leads us out of the station, and onto the main street."

    "The small suburb seems to be made up entirely of middle-sized homes, each with a small backyard."

    "The residents are probably all professionals that have chosen a little extra transit time for a little extra space."

    "However, even this place isn't free of urban sprawl."

    "As we move away from the station, duplexes start to appear amongst the houses."

    "We turn off the main street, and before long the single houses become the rarity."

    "After a few more turns, we find ourselves surrounded almost entirely by small apartment blocks built on adjacent lots."

    "Suddenly, Hanako stops in front of a run-down block of six apartments."

    "It looks to be a few years older than the blocks surrounding it."

    ha "This… this is it."

    ha "This is where we lived…"

    "It could have been any other apartment block in the world."

    "A block of mail boxes sits at the front of a small yard, surrounded by discarded toys."

    "Hanako pushes her way through the waist-high gate, and kneels down in the yard."

    ha "It was here."

    ha "The front door was right here…"

    "She looks up, as if looking at a phantom house in her imagination."

    ha "I guess that this is where they found me…"

    "She stands up, and takes a few steps inside the house in her mind."

    ha "And this… this is where my father died."

    hi "It's unbelievable…"

    hi "To think that he was so close…"

    ha "They told me my mother was found inside; she never had a chance…"

    ha "But my father grabbed me, and made sure I got out…"

    ha "So close…"

    "Hanako falls to her knees, crying."

    "I walk to her side, and place my hand on her shoulder."

    "Again, I am amazed at the difference that two steps made."

    "Here, Hanako's father died, yet barely a metre behind me, Hanako lived."

    "Yet we both managed to cross that border in about a second."

    "I bend down next to Hanako, and she throws her arms around me."

    "She mouths soundless words into my ears, and I hug her tightly."

    hi "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forced you to come here."

    ha "No… don't be."

    ha "I'm sorry that I never came before."

    "Hanako pulls away from me, and wipes her puffy eyes."

    hi "Really? Why?"

    ha "I never got the chance to thank my father."

    ha "He could have made it out himself, but he threw me outside instead."

    ha "All this time, after everything else that happened…"

    ha "I used to blame him."

    ha "For putting me in foster care, for my foster mother, for what I went through…"

    ha "I used to think “Why didn't you just let me die?”"

    ha "But… that isn't what he wanted."

    ha "He wanted me to live."

    ha "He knew it was either him or me, and he chose me."

    #Hanako resolute

    "Hanako stands up, and I stand up with her."

    "Without warning, she tilts her head backwards, and calls out."

    ha "Thank you!"

    #Hanako smile

    "I've never heard her speak so loud, but she is smiling from ear to ear."

    "She slowly tilts her head back to face me, still smiling."

    ha "Thank you too, Hisao."

    #Geh, this feels far to quick and "lol end of story nao" for me.

    ha "I think, without you, that I might have been stuck here forever."

    hi "You don't have to thank me, I forced you to come here…"

    ha "That's not what I meant."

    ha "I kept on looking at this as an excuse to never move on."

    ha "But I can't do that forever."

    ha "I'm never going to forget what happened here, but I don't want to let it hold me back anymore."

    ha "But… I can't do that alone."

    #So tempted to quote Retake here…

    ha "Hisao… will you help me?"

    ha "Will you promise me, with no regrets, to stay by my side?"

    hi "Yes… I promi…"

    "Hanako stops me mid-sentence with a long, deep kiss."

    ha "There, we promised with a kiss."

    "Stranger" "Hey, what are you two doing over there?"

    "A stranger stands at the letterbox, eyeing us with suspicion."

    hi "Um, we er…"

    ha "I used to live here, so I wanted to show my boyfriend."

    "Stranger" "What are you talking about?"

    "Stranger" "I moved in when this building first opened, and I don't remember ever seeing you here…"

    ha "Oh, well, I must have been mistaken."

    hi "We'll be on our way then, sorry for the disturbance…"

    "Stranger" "Yeah, well don't let me catch you around here again or I'm calling the cops."

    ha "Don't worry, we've got what we came for."

    "Stranger" "Just get out of here…"

    #BG Train station

    "Hanako and I wait on the empty train station, our heads resting against each other."

    hi "Are you sure you're really okay?"

    ha "Yes, I'm fine now."

    hi "Well then, what now?"

    ha "I think…"

    extend " that I want to meet your parents."

    hi "Really?"

    ha "Really."

    ha "I have some news that they might want to hear."

    hi "Oh, and what would that be?"

    hi "I'm late."

    #Lol baby end.
    #Game over.

    #Well, maybe. This is a bit of a Lol ending 'cause I want to ask advice from y'all.
