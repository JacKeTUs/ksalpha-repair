    #of course, this feeds directly on from the library scene.

    "Flustered, Hanako closes her book and clumsily stuffs it into her bag, all the while staring at me with a shocked expression."

    ha "S…sure."

    "Shouldering her bag, she pulls herself up, putting ever the slightest strain on my hand in the process."

    "I smile at her, gently, causing her blush to deepen, yet her eyes stay fixed on mine."

    "By this time, all activity around us has stopped, everyone taking in this absurd scene straight from every romance novel ever."

    "I have to give her hand a slight tug to start her walking."

    hi "Come on, let's go get that air."

    "Still dazed, Hanako follows me out of the library…"

    centered "*BEEP BEEP BEEP*"

    "Lights flash and sirens blare as we pass through the library's sensomatic doors."

    #not entirely sure what everyone else calls them, but you know those loss-prevention door things.

    "Hanako's shocked expression turns into one of terror as she realises that it was her that caused this calamity."

    "The librarian eyes her curiously as she runs to the loans desk and upends her bag."

    ha "ImsorryImsorrIforgotIhaditImsorry!"

    "The librarian smiles in a delicate manner, collects the book from the pile of Hanako's note books, and scans it into the system."

    "Librarian" "You take care now."

    ha "IwillI'msorryI'msosorry…"

    "Hanako packs her bag hurriedly, simply scooping the pile of books and stationary into the maw of her open schoolbag."

    hi "Alright, I think we've caused as much calamity as possible."

    hi "Let's leave these poor people in peace."

    "Dejected, Hanako fixes her gaze firmly on the ground, and follows me out of the library."

    "We wander aimlessly, drifting from the main building towards the gardens behind the Great Hall."

    "Along the way, I gather two cans of iced tea, and hand one to the still-smarting Hanako."

    hi "Here, this'll take your mind off things."

    hi "Nothing like a bit of tea to calm down the mind."

    ha "T…thanks."

    "It doesn't take a genius to tell that she's still distracted."

    "I sit down on a nearby bench, and Hanako silently copies me, carefully balancing her schoolbag against the bench before opening her can."

    hi "Lilly's pretty strong you know. She'll be up and about in no time."

    hi "It was only a minor operation, she'll be out in no time."

    "Hanako runs her finger around the can's rim slowly, gazing into it as if it held all of the answers to life's questions."

    ha "I…I know all that."

    ha "But I… don't know what to do. I don't know what I can do."

    hi "Eh? What do you mean?"

    "The finger stops in its travel, but remains pressed firmly against the can."

    ha "If… if it were one of us in that bed, don't you think Lilly would be doing something?"

    hi "I can't say I'm following you here."

    "Hanako sighs, and takes a sip of her tea."

    ha "I don't think I am either."

    ha "I just… want to do something for her, but I can't."

    ha "I feel… powerless."

    "Her words flow forth on a river of melancholy, but there are undercurrents of something else…"

    "Determination?"

    "That has to be it. Beneath Hanako's obvious lamenting, there is a driving force carrying immense power."

    "In an instant, my vision of Hanako is shattered and rebuilt."

    "She truly cares for Lilly, and wants to help her out…"

    extend " no matter what."

    "The timid Hanako disappears completely from my mind like the thin veil that it is."

    ha "W…what's the matter?"

    "Shaking myself back into reality, I realise that I've been staring at the flesh-and-blood Hanako whilst musing to myself."

    hi "Oh… er… it's nothing."

    hi "I was just thinking that you've changed since we've met…"

    "Damnit, I'm echoing Lilly's words."

    "But, now, I think I can see the truth behind them."

    #hanako blushing but happy

    ha "D…don't be silly."

    "The faint smile turning the corner of Hanako's lips upwards is immensely relieving."

    hi "Say, how about we go together to visit Lilly today?"

    "Hanako gingerly raises the can to her lips, and nods as she takes a drink."

    "Our interlude is interrupted by the distant ringing of the bells, summoning us back to the classroom."

    hi "We'd best be getting back. We'll leave straight after class, right?"

    ha "Okay."

    #a22, should you take offence, feel free to veto this next passage.
    #i just kinda got a bit excited of the new misha sprites and she popped up in my mind.

    "The first thing I notice as I enter the classroom is a contemplative Shizune carefully cleaning her glasses."

    "And, for some reason, the only thing I can think of is the terrified look of the wheelchair-bound student from the start of lunch."

    "I take advantage of Shizune's temporary distraction to whisper in Misha's ear."

    hi "Hey… did that guy survive? What did she do to him?"

    "Misha brightens at my attention, seeming all too eager to answer."

    mi "I don't know!"

    extend " But!"

    hi "Wait, don't…!"

    "Too late."

    "Misha has already spun around, and is tapping Shizune on the shoulder."

    "I reach out and grab Misha's hands before she can start incriminating me."

    "Her warm, soft hands…"

    "Wait! This is no time for fantasy, I need to stop her asking Shizune that question."

    mi "Eh? Hisao? Confessing? To me?"

    hi "No! That's not it at all."

    shi "…"

    "Misha pouts in an overly fake manner."

    mi "You're mean."

    hi "I just wanted to stop you before you asked Shizune about that."

    hi "I have a feeling she'd take it the wrong way…"

    #Misha lol

    mi "Whahahaha Hicchan! You make her sound like some kind of bad person!"

    mi "Just take a look at her, there's no way she could be a bad person!"

    hi "Just promise me you won't ask her that."

    mi "Oka~y!"

    "I release Misha's hands, which immediately go about the business of communicating with Shizune."

    "Damnit, I can tell Shizune knows that something is up, but I can't follow a single thing either of them are saying."

    "But, from the look on Shizune's face, I can guess."

    "I think I may have awoken a demon…"

    mi "Hiccha~n! Shizune wants to have a word with you!"

    mi "She wants to remind you that the student council is here for the students, not for their own amusement!"

    mi "Any disciplinary measures put into place are solely for the benefit of the student body, and not for the entertainment of the student council."

    hi "What exactly did you say to her?"

    mi "Oh, I can't remember any more."

    shi "…"

    mi "Ah, Shicchan has one more thing to say."

    #Misha stern/serious

    mi "“That boy will bother you no more.”"

    "My blood runs cold at the thought of what these two would do to a fellow student…"

    "Thankfully, I am freed from their stares by the arrival of the teacher and their lesson."

    #timeskip

    "As per usual, the classroom empties in the blink of an eye."

    "It takes mere seconds before Hanako and I are left alone."

    hi "So, shall we head straight out?"

    "Hanako simply nods, and we make our way to the bus stop."

    #inside bus

    "The first bus into town is surprisingly crowded."

    "I guess a lot of students want to put as much distance between themselves and the school as quickly as possible."

    "Hanako and I manage to secure a seat, but by the time the bus pulls away from the kerb, not a single free seat remains."

    "Getting any conversation out of Hanako in this environment is less likely than blood from a stone, so I look through my bag for something to read."

    "As I pass my fingers over my textbooks, I feel the plush texture of 3-3's gift to Lilly."

    "I almost forgot I had it in here."

    "Extracting the bear, I examine it once again."

    ha "I…is that for Lilly?"

    hi "Wha…? Oh, yeah."

    hi "Her classmates got it for her and asked me to deliver it."

    ha "Oh… I see."

    #Hanako sad, followed by a happy-ish Hanako

    ha "Hisao!"

    "Hanako's outburst causes me to jump in my seat, and I almost throw the bear in fright."

    hi "What?"

    extend " I mean, “What's the matter, Hanako?”"

    ha "We should get her something too…"

    ha "And something to make sure that bear isn't alone."

    "<Alone>"

    "There's that word again."

    "I'm sure that Hanako's words are simply a coincidence, but I have a niggling feeling in the back of my head that there's something more to it."

    "I wonder…"

    extend " was Lilly perhaps talking about herself and Hanako?"

    hi "That's a good idea. There's a gift shop at the hospital, maybe we could get something there."

    "Hanako shakes her head, her stare fixed upon the bear in my hands."

    ha "No… those gifts have no… no…"

    ha "…soul…"

    "Again, Hanako's voice has the hard-edged determination that it had earlier in the day."

    "Her eyes are ablaze with some inner passion."

    "But this time, I think I can relate to how she feels."

    hi "You're right."

    hi "Actually, I know just the thing for this occasion, though it will require a slight detour…"

    #background Antique shop

    ha "Othello's… Antiques?"

    hi "Yeah, I found it when I was looking for Lilly's birthday present."

    ha "Oh…"

    "I make a beeline straight for the Steiff bear I noticed on my last visit."

    hi "It's a little expensive, but I think…"

    #Hanako srsbsns

    ha "It's perfect."

    "I had barely lifted the bear off the shelf before Hanako had responded."

    "Slowly, tenderly, she takes the bear from my hands, and holds it to her face."

    "As she stands there, eyes closed, hugging the bear, I feel somehow saddened that I'm buying this for Lilly and not her."

    "Wheels turn in my head, and I start to calculate."

    "If I can constrict myself to drinking only water and eating only what the school provides me, I should be able to pull this off."

    "Under my breath, I thank my parents for the slight swell in allowance for this month."

    "Before Hanako opens my eyes again, I swipe the bear's companion from the shelf, wave to the store owner, and stuff it into my bag."

    "I grab a collection of notes out of my wallet, and, whilst pointing at Hanako, I jam the money under another of the bears upon the shelf."

    "He gives me a puzzled look, and I desperately try to explain to him using sign language."

    "I've watched Shizune and Misha do this a heap of times."

    "Why is he just looking at me like I'm having a fit?"

    "Just as I'm about to walk over and explain everything to him, Hanako releases the bear."

    ha "Excuse me, but we'd like to buy this."

    "Storeowner" "Ah… sure thing, miss."

    "Storeowner" "Is this for you, Lilly?"

    "Hanako gawks at the store owner, and I close my eyes, wishing that this whole situation had never occurred."

    ha "H…how did you know this was for Lilly?"

    "Storeowner" "Well, I remember the young man here from his last visit."

    "Storeowner" "He got me to engrave “Lilly” on a music box."

    "Storeowner" "So I thought that might be you… seeing as… oh!"

    "It seems that the gears in his head have finally made the connection."

    hi "Lilly is a mutual friend of ours that's in hospital."

    hi "But I'm surprised you remembered."

    "Storeowner" "Ah, well, I've got this thing for faces."

    hi "And names, apparently."

    "Storeowner" "Well, it was a unique order."

    ha "So… how much is this?"

    "The store owner looks at me, then at my bag, then at the shelf that conceals my payment for the bear hidden in my school bag."

    "Storeowner" "I tell you what, I'll cut you a bargain, a “Get-well” special. Six thousand, even."

    "I grimace, knowing that I left almost twice that on the shelf behind us."

    #Hanako happy

    "Hanako, however, is delighted."

    ha "T…thank you!"

    "I smile as I fish out my wallet for a second time, and give the owner the remains of my cash."

    "Storeowner" "…and here's your receipt. I hope Lilly gets well soon!"

    hi "Cheers."

    ha "Thank you ever so much."

    "Hanako bows ever so slightly. It's the first time I've ever seen her be so formal."

    "It's strangely charming."

    "Storeowner" "Do you need a bag for that, or…"

    "Hanako shakes her head."

    ha "No, I'll carry it, thank you."

    "True to her word, Hanako carries the bear against her chest, hugging it from behind."

    "The little bell on the door rings as I put my wallet into my pants."

    "I sigh a little as I feel how light it is compared to when I entered the store."

    "I am such an idiot sometimes."

    "In fact, since we all met, only Hanako has changed."

    "She's become more confident. Even Lilly agrees to that."

    "She's talking to me, and no longer acting like a lost sheep when Lilly's not around."

    "Lilly is still just Lilly, and, apart from sleeping less, I'm still me."

    "She really does seem to care for everyone, no matter how small their problem."

    "But something else now fills my vision; my bulging school bag."

    "I guess there's no point in holding onto that bear forever."

    "And if I hold onto it for too long before giving it to her, she's going to think I'm weird."

    hi "Look, here, I brought you a present."

    "I proffer the bear to Hanako, who initially shies away from my outstretched arms."

    #Hanako surprised

    "But, as her tear-stained eyes recognize the form before her, shock spreads across her face."

    "She stares at it in disbelief, and I feel as if the world has ground to a halt."

    "Eventually, she reaches out with shaking hands, and lifts the bear from my palms."

    "Her grip on the bear is like that of a new mother holding her child for the first time; tender yet protective."

    hi "So, what do you… oof!"

    "I barely start to speak before Hanako lurches forward into my chest, wedging the bear between us."

    ha "How…? When…?"

    hi "Well, er, when I saw you in the shop I thought you looked good together."

    hi "Sure, I guess I can stay for a bit."

    hi "Let me put the kettle on."

    "Hanako nods, and slowly releases my sleeve."

    "She stumbles backwards, and sits awkwardly on Lilly's bed."

    "As I fill the kettle and switch it on, she fumbles through Lilly's bed sheets until her hand rests on the tattered rabbit."

    "Without looking, she scoops up the rabbit and brings it into her field of vision, gently resting it against the bear on her lap."

    "What a strange sight we must make; Hanako staring intently at two toys whilst I watch her from across the room."

    "The kettle whistles, and I fill the waiting pot with the steaming water."

    "As if guided by some invisible hand, I place the teapot on Lilly's small table, and then sit down next to Hanako."

    "I've been in Lilly's room a number of times, but this is the first time I've ever touched her bed."

    "The springs respond a little as I sit, and I can faintly smell Lilly on the sheets."

    "But, right now, our blind friend is miles from my mind."

    "There's something to Hanako's reaction that makes me incapable of thought."

    "I didn't exactly expect her to be ecstatic, but I didn't expect her to just stop, either."

    "Still, she certainly looks a little cheerier than she did when she first opened the door."

    "… I think."

    hi "So, I guess your friend there isn't alone anymore, right?"

    #Hanako Shocked

    ha "Eeh?"

    "Hanako starts a little at my question, as if she had forgotten that I was in the room entirely."

    "The salt from her tears mixes with the latent taste of lip-balm as we kiss."

    "I feel a pressure on my back, and realise that Hanako has wrapped her arms around me, pulling me into this ever-deepening embrace."

    yu "Well, I found my boyfriend again!"

    "I know that both Yuuko and Kenji have mentioned that they had lost their respective partners, but this seems to make no sense at all."

    "Then again, that alone makes it make perfect sense."

    "My fragile mind can't take any more abuse, so I start shovelling the hot breakfast into my mouth as quickly as I can."

    ha "So, how did you two meet?"

    yu "Well, he used to come here every so often, always by himself, so I started talking to him."

    yu "Then, you know, we were out drinking one night, and one thing led to another…"

    hi "Dedicated enough to just disappear for however long without telling you he was just up the road the whole time?"

    yu "What can I say? Sometimes people just need some space…"

    "Something tells me that, against all odds, Yuuko and Kenji are just… made for each other."

    "However, they were not made for me."
