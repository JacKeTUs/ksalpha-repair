Katawa Shoujo Prealpha Repair
==============

**Documentation**: https://github.com/stanriders/ksalpha-repair/wiki/KS-ALPHA-CHEATSHEET-by-muffinduck01

**What needs to be done**: 
 * First: **/game/Dev Files/Shit To Do.txt**
 * After that do a full playthough and make an actual todo-list.
 * Stop messing with README.

**Done**:
 * Hanako routes (both good and bad)
 * Not sure about anything else.
